Summary: A shapeshifter with an identity crisis and survivor's guilt.

# Fusion

Fusion is a member of [Team Lambda].

Fusion can look like almost anyone. His/her gender is fluid based on the role he/she is playing at the time. However, one of the more common shapes is an ethnically Indian woman, slight of build, wearing body armor and armed with several firearms.

Position
--------

Fusion is the shapeshifter and mimic of the team. He/she can borrow other superpowers (if they have a biological origin), and even duplicate the mental state of another being, partially or wholly.

Past
----

Dr. Megan Rao is an Indian-American psychologist from New York. Her involvement in the superhuman world began with a meeting with the hero called Magnum. He approached her initially to deal with his conflicted feelings about being a hero, and retaining his secret identity. Dr. Rao worked with him, performing a fair amount of research into superhuman psychology in the process. In time their relationship turned personal as well as professional.

Unfortunately Megan found herself kidnapped by the supervillain Hong Long. The so-called Red Dragon was himself a psychologist and had been studying Megan's research papers, concluded that she was working with a superhero, and gambled successfully that capturing her would lead him to one or more heroes. Using his advanced technology, he duplicated her mind into a computer and searched her memory for any secret identities she might know.

When Magnum came to save her, he couldn't locate her original body. He was able to at least transfer her consciousness into one of the Dragon's prototype infiltration units - a bioroid with advanced shapeshifting and duplication capabilities, intended to assist in taking control of world leaders. Unfortunately Magnum and Hong Long battled in the villain's lair, and both were killed. In the explosion and chaos, Megan escaped the facility but was unable to recover her former self or her lover.

Not even sure if she was herself any more or simply a conscious clone of the original Megan Rao, she contacted Magnum's former teammates in search of assistance. Her old life had already proven dangerous to the people she cared about, even if they were merely clients and not lovers. She was presumed dead in the explosion. She felt an obligation to Magnum as well, to carry on the heroic work he'd dedicated his life to doing.

* _Ladyhawke Option_: Megan got to Magnum as he lay dying, and was able to copy his body and brain. Unfortunately she can't communicate with him except by swapping places - they could leave messages behind for each other, sharing a body but never meeting.
* _Jekyll/Hyde Option_: Hong Long left a sample of his own body and brain patterns in the bioroid, which can be activated again under certain conditions.
* _Angel of Death Option_: Fusion visits hospitals to copy dying people, giving them a temporary chance to live again or to see how the world has moved on without them. Perhaps with [Link](link)'s help, android bodies could eventually be built for such people.
* _Lash Option_: the copy of Hong Long in Fusion must work with her to defeat a (more) evil Hong Long-alpha.

Personality
-----------

Megan Rao is dead. The being who holds Megan's memories has become more and more ruthless in her experiments on the human mind, though she retains a code of ethics. Her subject is herself, and the question she wishes to answer is "who am I?"

Megan's outward personality is somewhat fluid. She will adopt or drop traits from time to time, or borrow qualities from people she admires.

Powers
------

Fusion's powers, derived from Hong Long's imitative bioroid technology, allow her to duplicate (in whole or in part) the bodies or minds of other people. The bioroid body is able to take a tissue sample (not just genetic data, but also the current state of the tissue), and/or use a high-performance SQUID to map neural activity. This captures an _image of the body or brain at the time of contact_, rather than creating an ongoing connection.

This sample data may be stored indefinitely, and used at any time. Taking a sample does not harm the original target. She requires physical contact to perform the scan, due to the extremely short range of the SQUID sensor, and there are several sorts of superpower she cannot access.

Over time, she has become able to splice parts of other peoples' memories or personalities onto her own, to the extent that they are compatible; she can even let an entirely different mind take control of her body for a time.

She has used these abilities to perform the following feats:

* Shapeshifting into other people, and convincingly imitating their personality traits.
* Acquiring others' biologically-based super powers, or mixing powers from multiple individuals.
* Acquiring new skill sets or talents by incorporating muscle memory or knowledge from others' bodies or minds.
* Resisting telepathic intrusion by repeatedly overdubbing her thoughts with random data, or resisting mind control by repeatedly resetting her mental state to a known good version.
* Allowing others to interrogate a villain by copying that villain's mind and storing it for later, then restoring it when her body is immobilized.

She fights using a variety of tactics and powers, all copied from other supers (either fellow heroes or from villains she's come into contact with).

The bioroid body's shapeshifting capabilities are tied closely to its regenerative abilities, allowing Fusion to heal quickly from most injuries.

Problems
--------

Fusion is a blank slate, a tabula rasa. She has memories of her life as Megan Rao, but no great commitment to carrying them on. Now she splices other lives into her own with the detachment of a psychic surgeon, trying desperately to find a level of comfort in who she is. Anyone who can offer that feeling will have a powerful hold on her.

Her ability to adopt others' minds means she is replacing her own; she must make provisions, either via a trigger system or timer in her own body, to restore her own memory, or else her identity might be lost forever.

It's possible that Megan's original body and mind survived the transfer and escaped from Hong Long's fortress; in that case, Fusion's crisis of identity would probably worsen.

Hong Long himself was a master of mind duplication; presumably he made provisions for his own survival, and may return as a recurring villain.

* "Self-sacrifice is worth it for the right reasons."
* "I am the laboratory for my experiments in self."
* "Who I am is malleable; who I want to be is unknown."
* "Memories are the only thing we really have in this world."
* "I don't want to know your secrets, I have enough trouble with my own."
