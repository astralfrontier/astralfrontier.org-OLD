# Bluescreen

Bluescreen is a member of [Team Lambda].

Bluescreen is a human male. His eyes glow a lambent blue, and a similar light radiates from the interior of his body. He typically wears full-body Kevlar armor, colored similarly. He is capable of creating and reshaping force fields around himself. He is a nationally registered law enforcement officer, specializing in superhuman crimes.

Position
--------

Bluescreen is the team brick. His force fields provide a powerful defense from attack, and can retain air and temperature in otherwise-hostile environments. When wrapped close to his body, the fields give him the ability to lift and move massive weights or do considerable damage. He has developed other uses, such as the "compression bubble" attack.

Past
----

Bluescreen is a former astrophysicist who worked at a radio observatory. One day the facility was struck by something, which Bluescreen believes was an alien transmission of some kind, and its computers and electronics blew out entirely. Working there alone at the time, he'd lost consciousness and revived to find himself faintly glowing and endowed with his powers.

Feeling a strong sense of civic responsibility, he applied to become a sanctioned agent of a national police organization and fight super-criminals with his abilities. He thinks of science as valuable, but realizes his unique gifts have given him a different role to play.

Personality
-----------

Bluescreen is motivated by a sense of duty to society. He was inspired by classic space opera and scifi serials depicting heroes who save civilization. As a science fiction fan, he found himself drawn to astronomy and astrophysics from a young age.

He tends to get caught up in his role. He can be more flamboyant and larger-than-life when acting as a superhero, sometimes doing or saying things he would be embarrassed by in his "civilian" persona.

Powers
------

Bluescreen can create and reshape translucent blue force fields around his body. The closer the field is to him, the stronger and more controllable it becomes.

He can use this power to achieve several feats, including:

* Flight, by levitating his body via force field.
* Personal armor and defensive barriers to protect himself and others and provide temporary life support.
* Force blades and edged shapes to cut through tough objects.
* "Compression bubbles", consisting of a spherical force field wrapped around a volume of air. The field is shrunk, greatly increasing the pressure inside. When Bluescreen releases it, the blast of air causes tremendous outward pressure.

Bluescreen typically makes nonlethal attacks, either using field-enhanced strength or compression bubbles. He reserves his force blades for inanimate objects, vehicles, and the like.

Problems
--------

His body's natural luminescence makes it impossible for him to hold a secret identity, although he can take steps to conceal it when stealth is needed.

He is a well known crimefighter, and has earned the wrath of several super-criminals in the past.
