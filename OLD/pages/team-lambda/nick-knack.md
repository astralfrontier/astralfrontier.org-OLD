# Nick Knack

Nick Knack is a member of Team Lambda.

Nick is an ex-cop, now private detective. He has the power of _psychometry_: reading past impressions from physical objects. He can channel psychic energy from such objects into his other, normally latent, psi powers.

Nick wears a fisherman's jacket, and a fireman's air mask over his face. His pants, boots, and gloves are leather. A long scarf is wrapped around his neck. He wears a variety of small trinkets, from a plastic hospital bracelet to handmade keychains, and carries several other such items in a satchel. The overall ensemble is of course a fashion disaster.

Position
--------

Nick's team role is detective and mentalist. He has physical gifts (biokinesis, psychokinesis, and teleportation included) but will more often be called on to use his psychometry or deductive reasoning on a case.

Past
----

> "For as long as I can remember, I've had minor psychic abilities. I've heard the names: biokinesis, psychokinesis, ESP. I never thought of them as anything unusual. They were just a part of growing up."

> "For some reason, I had a knack for psychometry. I could touch something, or be in a place, and I'd share in the most intense impressions tied to that thing. I'd always amaze my family by telling them about their stuff, and they would assume they'd shared the story with me before."

> "I became a cop, and married Deena. I could feel peoples' pain when I was younger and I hated it. I wanted to put a big fat bandaid over the entire world. I didn't really have much career ambition past that."

> "Then Jasmine was born. And then Deena got her diagnosis."

> "We talked it over and I realized I needed more. More money, more ambition. I applied for detective. I almost didn't make it, but some unofficial recommendations got me in."

> "Then there was the Lenowski case."

> "Multiple murders, the worst I'd ever seen personally. I tried to sense the crime scene, just like I always do. It was too much. I don't remember what happened next. The reports say that I flipped out. Went entirely berserk and started assaulting everyone on the scene. Reggie got shot in the arm when I pulled my piece. They had to take me down hard and keep me sedated."

> "They called it work-related stress, and I got some time off. I took time, I practiced, I worked to get it under control. It wasn't enough the next time. And I got busted down to beat cop. My reputation as a "finder" wasn't enough to keep me on the force even then. I hadn't worked on my core skills. I used psychometry and ESP to get by, and now that I was holding that back, my job performance suffered."

> "Deena and I separated amicably. I'd started to notice that Jasmine had gifts like mine, so the only real fight was for custody. We agreed to split our time equally. I became a private investigator, and I spent as much time in an office as I could. This time I wasn't going to slip up."

> "I found a way to make it not overwhelm me. The surge of feelings I get from psychometry makes the rest of my psi stronger. A lot stronger. As long as I'm channeling that, it's bearable. And some items have such strong feelings behind them that I can do incredible things. I've hurt a few people and disappointed a lot more. I decided it's time to make up for that."

Personality
-----------

Nick is trying to make up for his past mistakes. He used to lack career ambition, until his wife developed cancer. He was unable to cope with the later stages of her treatment. Now that his daughter is showing signs of psionic potential, he is trying to be more responsible to them.

Nick is searching for a trinket that will focus his biokinesis enough to entirely cure his wife of cancer. Barring that, he wants to find a super capable of doing the same.

Powers
------

Nick carries around a large assortment of apparently mundane items. Each one is charged with significant memories and emotions, which he can sense and channel through his psychometry. Each item energizees one or more of his basic psi powers (ESP, telepathy, teleportation, biokinesis, and so on), allowing him to perform feats somewhat approximating the item's own significant stories. For example, his lucky fisherman's jacket provides him with a focus for a powerful psychokinetic shield.

**Lucky Coat** (Psychokinesis - defensive shield)

> "This old thing was worn by a man who spent years on a boat in Alaska. One year he got thrown overboard while they were pulling in their nets. Everyone thought he was lost. But when the nets were hauled up, he was there, clinging like a drowned rat. Guy was unstoppable. Even cut himself free."

**Survivor's Bracelet** (Biokinesis - regeneration)

> "Deena beat her cancer, beat her doctors' expectations, beat everything. When she left the hospital, she was bald and pale, but she was smiling."

**Gearshift Knob**

> "A truck driver rolled his rig one night. Bad weather, and thankfully he didn't hit anyone. He walked away from it, and from truck driving, but he kept this knob as a souvenir."

**Stuffed Toy** (Telepathy - mind to mind communication)

> "A child's stuffed animal, invested with years of whispered confessions. He would talk to it and listen to what it had to say, which was usually pretty smart. I guess he didn't have many real people around to talk to."

**Firefighter's Mask** (Biokinesis - life support and strength enhancement)

> "The man came out of the burning building with two children under their arm. And then he went back for their dog, because they were crying for it. He didn't just keep them alive, he protected what was important to them too. The courage to keep going back into such danger gave him the strength that got him back out again."

**Broken-Banded Watch** (Telekinesis - lifting)

> "A mother lifted a car off her child after an accident. I mean literally lifted it. She strained her back so badly that she's in a wheelchair now and collecting disability. The watch literally broke off her wrist from the effort, and she was timing her resuscitation attempts with it."

**Wedding Ring** (Telepathy and teleportation - homing in on someone important)

> "Their vows were exchanged in the church. But she made him another promise when they were alone: whenever you need me, I'll be there. Nothing can keep me away from you."

**Katana** (Psychokinesis - molecular sharpness, improved attack speed, improved cutting power)

> "Yeah, it's one of those cheap knockoff weapons you'll find at mall outlets all over America. That didn't stop its owner from using it to hold off an armed robber in someone else's house. Bravest thing he ever did, and he was scared shitless at the time."

**Bean Ball** (Psychokinesis - ranged attack)

> "Mike Gonzalez pitched against Chris Dickerson in 2011. The result was a head hit, a cracked helmet, and a scramble to find some pitchers. Don't ask me how I got my hands on it - that's a story all its own."

Problems
--------

Unless he channels the energy into another psi power, Nick's psychometry can become overwhelming. In the past, he has lost control of his actions and instead acted out the sensations he would receive from his readings. He is working to control this aspect of his power.

Nick relied too heavily on psychometry as a detective. He believes he should also be improving his mundane skills.

* "Lost souls and small treasures are my business."
* "I have to make it up to everyone for making things hard for them."
* "I have to be there for my psychic daughter."
* "Everything, even the tiniest things, has a story behind it."
* "I can live with whatever I have to do to get the job done."

Scenario
--------

Something had led Nick to the bank that day. It wasn't money - he had enough in his pocket to last the week, for once. But when the men in masks poured in with their rifles, he knew he was in the right place. Unfortunately he'd left his stuff in the car.

Following standard procedure - namely, what they'd probably seen on television - the robbers corralled their hostages into a huddled group in the corner while they tried to intimidate someone in charge into opening the vault. Nick figured two things out pretty quickly. First, that these guys weren't really experienced, but that they were dangerous, and second, that this was going to turn into a hostage crisis when the cops arrived.

Sure enough, sirens outside and Lt. Dixon on the loudspeaker made Nick feel briefly nostalgic. He scanned the people on the ground with him, and he opened his senses. There - three items. More than enough. Quietly he tapped the old woman on the shoulder and whispered a plea for her ring. No good - it was too precious to her, and this mysterious request was too much to process. His second subject handed over a hankerchief willingly enough. The third wasn't willing to hand over his pocketknife at first, but Nick offered him $40 for it.

It was all he could do to keep from shaking - the power of even these two items was strong, but so were the memories. But Nick flipped the blade out and began with a series of slashing motions. Some of the robbers dropped their guns as psychokinetic force struck them. One noticed Nick standing up from the group and raised his weapon. In response, Nick held out the hankerchief, and bullets sprayed uselessly over the PK barrier he'd erected with it. The knife flew from his hand, ending up in the chest of the gunman. As Nick used the last of the residual psychic charge to call a rifle into his hands and aim it, the thieves bolted for the door.

Outside, Nick handed the knife over to Dixon, and pointed out the former owner. "Listen, you've known me long enough to know I don't make wild accusations," he confided. "That guy there has been using this knife and a lot more for... well, the shed on his property has plenty of evidence. Look, do whatever you have to. Send some black and whites around to his house, anything."

Dixon let out a long-suffering sigh. "This was our bust, Nick. But you handled it fast and clean, and nobody got hurt. Come downtown, make a statement, and we'll see what we can do about this other thing, all right?"
