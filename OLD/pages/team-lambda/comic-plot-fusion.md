# Comic Plot: Fusion

Prelude
-------

For this story to work, the following must be true:

* Fusion must have been working to establish a secret identity.
* Fusion must have duplicated [Cloud]'s powers in the past.

Summary
-------

[Team Lambda]'s members check in with [Fusion], only to find she's missing. Her apartment was abruptly vacated.

What Happened?
--------------

Hong Long embedded a copy of his personality within Fusion's bioroid body, as a safety measure in case of his own death. Once a month, it is programmed to "wake up", call a phone number tied to a voicemail box, and listen for a coded message. The real Hong Long would leave the message beforehand; if it was received, the copy would go back to sleep. If there was no message, however, the copy would stay active as the new Hong Long.

Story
-----

[Nick Knack] investigates Fusion's apartment and uses his psychometry to find out what happened. He feels a psychic charge still on the phone and realizes that Fusion made a phone call which had a strong emotional impact on her. He works with his police contacts to pull phone records around the time of her disappearance, in order to find out who or where she called.

Nick discovers the existence of the voicemail box. He does some research into Fusion's past. Thanks to the memorabilia in her apartment, he learns about Magnum's final fight against Hong Long. He concludes that there must be a "sleeper" personality in action; this is corroborated as his telepathy is unable to locate Fusion's mind.

Believing that whoever is in Fusion's body might start examining the different copied forms for their capabilities, [Bluescreen] uses his radio astronomy experience and [Link]'s robots to set up a city-wide scan for a certain signal. If the enemy adopts [Cloud]'s powers and his distinctive cellular radar appears again, he can track down the source.

Nick sends [Diver] to monitor Hong Long's old headquarters, in case he returns there.

Hong Long has taken refuge at a safe-house, and does indeed experiment with the body's powers. Bluescreen alerts his own contacts in law enforcement that Hong Long may be active again, but after resolving some conflicted feelings, he does not give them the details out of respect for his teammate. He alerts the rest of Team Lambda to the signal's location.

The team arrives at the safe house and get into a fight with Hong Long. The villain escapes, however.

Hong Long decides he needs to re-equip himself. He plans a takeover of the company owned by Link's civilian persona.
