# Interactions

A team is more than just a roster of members. Here's ways in which the members of this particular team could support each other.

Bluescreen can construct force fields behind Diver's illusions to make them as solid as real objects.

Diver can sneak Cloud's blood samples into well-guarded areas to give him sensory access, or use them to generate a burst of EM noise to disable security systems. She can also siphon the light out of an area, letting him use his cellular radar in place of sight and blinding anyone who can't see in the dark.

Link can provide transportation for the whole team. His intelligent androids can conceivably act as a psychometric focus for Nick's powers.

Nick Knack can use telepathy to read the minds that Fusion imitates.

Fusion can use her cloning powers to duplicate Cloud's cellular radar, thus expanding Cloud's own range to wherever Fusion is located.
