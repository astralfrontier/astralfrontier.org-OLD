# Link

Link is a member of Team Lambda.

Leonard "Leo" Snow, aka Link, is the son of a criminal gadgeteer. His father implanted him with a neurochip at an early age to combat an otherwise-fatal condition with his brain. The chip gave Leonard some part of his father's gadgeteering genius, which he uses to fight crime.

Position
--------

Link is not a traditional gadgeteer. Rather than building devices to use, he builds intelligent and modular robots. Link scales up in power when he combines with his creations, and expands his range of operations by dispatching them to other places. He is able to come up with technical solutions to challenges, to perform scientific analyses, and so on.

Past
----

> "My relationship with my dad is complicated."

> "When I was about five years old, I was diagnosed with a rare and pretty much inoperable condition with the nerves in my brain. Dad was - is - a brilliant inventor. He devised a 'neurochip' that would cure the problem, did the surgery himself, even embedded enough of his own fantastic brain into the damn thing that it taught me how to fix it myself, if he wasn't around."

> "That was during the time dad wasn't in jail, or being chased by public super-teams. Most of the time, I only knew about him from police reports, newspaper headlines, and the media trying to interview my foster parents of the moment. Then dad would bust out, take me back, and go on the road again for a week."

> "I started experimenting with robotic toys. I taught myself computers. I got into a lot of trouble, frankly. I always wondered, was that just youthful rebellion, or just another aspect of the chip that was affecting my brain? Or maybe it was in the genes, and I really did inherit the old man's wicked tendencies. I don't know, but it always bothered me. I convinced myself I was never going to be like him, and I worked hard to clean up my act. The FBI watched me pretty closely after a certain point, when I started really building interesting stuff."

> "Say what you will about my dad, but he did a lot of good too. When I turned eighteen, they gave me control of his legal assets - enough to make me a millionaire. He's pretty pissed off about that."

Personality
-----------

Leo isn't quite the genius gadgeteer his father was. He gets flashes of inspiration, not a continuous stream of brilliance, and more often than not he wakes up from a fainting spell with a completed set of blueprints in front of him. It's been enough for him to start construction on a series of transforming robots, and a powered suit of armor for himself. He has a purpose now: to stop his father, to make him pay for what he's done, and to stop similar gadgeteer villains and people who use their creations. Going by the name Link, he fights against the misuse of technology.

Powers
------

Leo wears the Link Suit, a streamlined black battlesuit with digitigrade legs for faster ground movement. It incorporates a line gun that can fire self-adhesive and retractable cabling to grab nearby objects or people and to move rapidly in a three-dimensional environment.

Leo's most ambitious project was a robotic companion for himself, built in the image of the perfect girl. He gave her the most advanced artificial intelligence and body he could, and he named her Pneuma when she was fully activated. For a time, he thought he had found a soul mate; but for whatever reason, he and his perfect girl weren't at all compatible. They remain best friends and allies in battle to this day, but they argue constantly. Pneuma will occasionally accompany him on an important mission; most of the time, she masquerades as the beautiful personal assistant to Leo Snow while Link is busy, keeping in touch via radio.

Link's suit can combine with a transforming sports car, called the Link Plus, with its own on-board computer, containing an AI named Speedy. In the combined mode, the suit is much more powerful and Leo can tackle hostile combat robots or military vehicles. Speedy can navigate the Link Plus on his own, or supplement Leo's own driving.

Leo typically takes on gadgeteers or people using high-tech weapons. Though he doesn't use weapons himself, his suit is strong enough to lift a small car by itself, and move much faster than a person on foot. He'll merge with the Link Plus for tougher targets, like battlesuit-equipped supervillains, or when he needs more muscle or defense than normal for some other reason.

Leo has built other androids and devices, and will use them from time to time depending on his situation.

Problems
--------

Link has dedicated himself to stopping villainous gadgeteers, principally his father. He'll go out of his way to pick fights with such individuals, considering it his mission in life. Since his identity is not a secret, he often feels that the only people who can be close to him are his android creations - anyone else runs the risk of injury.

Because of his skills and family, he is regarded warily by many law enforcement organizations.

He is not a naturally gifted gadgeteer. His ability to comprehend and build super-technology is not always under his control.

* "I don't build gadgets or tools, I build friends."
* "My inventions always get out of control, so now I just let them work."
* "My father has to be stopped, and I'll be the one to do it."
* "In any situation, the good and the bad are usually tightly coupled."
* "Belligerent best friends with Pneuma, my gynoid assistant."
