[Class Guide](http://www.minmaxboards.com/index.php?topic=480.0)

In general, the Witch is a low-rent Wizard with a living spellbook, several at-will special abilities (making up for the wizard's expendable spells), but also lacking some of the more interesting Wizard spells like *haste* or *wish*. Witches are buffing and debuffing machines.

### Hex Recommendations

In conjunction with a few of the buff and debuff hexes, Cackle is amazing. You can maintain such things for the entire combat as a move action.

At-will Slumber (limited to one attempt per day on a given target, to be sure) is the selling point of the class at lower levels, where an equivalent Wizard will be running out of *color spray* and *sleep* spells pretty fast.
