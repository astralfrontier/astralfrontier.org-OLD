# The Scrollmaster

This is my class guide for the [Scrollmaster] Wizard archetype in Pathfinder.

The archetype has three abilities, which replace [Arcane Bond][wizard-arcane-bond] and the 10th-level [Wizard bonus feat][wizard-bonus-feat]:

* _Scroll Blade_: you can wield a scroll as a short sword with an enhancement bonus based on the spell level on the scroll.
* _Scroll Shield_: you can wield a scroll as a light wooden shield.
* _Improved Scroll Casting_: you use your own INT, feats, and caster level for spells cast from scrolls.

Many people feel that the Scrollmaster is a weak archetype. This is true, but here are some ways to make it useful, or analyses of specific weaknesses.

Scroll Blade
------------

At 5th level, you can use a Wizard scroll with a level 4 or higher spell to reduce the enhancement bonus of your spell blade in exchange for the [Defending](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/defending) property. This requires that you know _shield_ (as a first-level spell, you will). At this point, you gain a +1, +2, or +3 to AC for 700 gp, 1680 gp, or 3000 gp respectively - the cost to buy a 4th, 6th, or 8th level scroll respectively. Compared to the _bracers of armor_ (armor vs. untyped bonus, anywhere from 70% to 33% of the cost), this is a pretty good bargain - you can still benefit from _mage armor_ or similar effects, among other things.

This is effectively a slotless magic item (since you're wielding it, not wearing it) and you can wield it in your offhand (there's no penalty to anything since you aren't attacking). Your main hand is then free to hold a staff, wand, or whatever.

**Verdict**: slotless wondrous item that gives an stacking AC bonus, for half the cost of _bracers of armor_.

Scroll Shield
-------------

A light wooden shield is good for a shield bonus of +1 to AC (which will not stack with _shield_ or similar effects). You would need to get a 6th level scroll (1680 gp) to get a total of +4 to AC, and the scroll will be destroyed after six attacks.

"Attacks" includes any attack roll against AC, including touch attacks such as rays, firearms, and so on. This makes Scroll Shield a bad investment for common use; if you're going to be expending a scroll, why not just buy a scroll of _shield_ and cast that?

There are only two spells I can find that specifically target shields:

* [Magic vestment](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-vestment) grants an enhancement bonus to a shield. For a cantrip or 1st level scroll with no enhancement bonus, this should be effective. However, the party cleric probably has better people to cast this on.
* [Ward shield](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/ward-shield) targets "one shield", granting SR 10 + caster level and a +5 bonus on Reflex saves against area effect spells. Useful in caster duels, when the wizard knows he's not likely to face melee, ranged, or ray attacks, but does need a strong spell defense.

Aside from these, Scroll Shield becomes more useful when you have other AC buffs going, and just need to push yourself over the top into invulnerability.

**Verdict**: useless unless you need an emergency source of AC, give this a pass.

Enhancement Bonuses
-------------------

The enhancement bonuses from Scroll Blade and Scroll Shield are half the level of the highest-level *Wizard* spell on the scroll. Thus, many divine and some arcane scrolls are of no use.

Since the bonus rounds down, and since the major usefulness of such scrolls starts at spell level 4, we are only interested in scrolls containing spells of wizard levels 4, 6, or 8.

However, we might be able to reduce the cost of our scrolls. For example, consider _haste_. This is a sorcerer/wizard 3 spell, but summoner 2. If a summoner scribes the scroll (market price 200gp), that same spell is on the wizard list at 3rd level. Does this mean that, for the purposes of the Scroll Blade & Shield abilities, that it's a third-level scroll?

Based on the [Scrolls] cost table, it's always cheaper to buy a limited caster's scrolls than to craft your own. At 5th level, it's only cheaper to buy a limited caster's scroll if it's 3rd level. Above that, it's cheaper to make your own.

* Level 2: Daze Monster (sor/wiz 2, summoner 1) - 125 gp savings
* Level 4: Ghost Wolf (sor/wiz 4, summoner 2) - 500 gp savings
* Level 6: Cat's Grace, Mass (sor/wiz 6, summoner 4) - 650 gp savings
* Level 8: Binding (sor/wiz 8, summoner 6) - 600 gp savings

**Verdict**: check with your GM before indulging in this level of cheese. If approved, buy limited casters' scrolls up to wizard level 5, then scribe your own.

Preventing Scroll Destruction
-----------------------------

[Make whole](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/make-whole) and [mending](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mending) cannot be used to repair scrolls damaged by the class abilities of the Scrollmaster. _Make whole_ explicitly says it cannot repair destroyed scrolls, while the Scroll Blade and Scroll Shield abilities explicitly say the damage they take cannot be repaired.

Does [hardness](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment---final/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness) affect the incoming damage? Probably not, as any hardness at all would render the whole limiting factor moot.

**Verdict**: scrolls probably can't be repaired or restored.

Improved Scroll Casting
-----------------------

This is it - this is why you take this archetype.

My GM interprets "your feats" as including those that come from metamagic rods, meaning I can use (for example) a _lesser metamagic rod of dazing_ on a 1st-level Magic Missile scroll (25gp), doing 5d4+5 without a saving throw, and dazing up to 5 targets for 1 turn if they fail a Will save (the DC being set by my Intelligence and any relevant feats).

**Verdict**: So awesome. Get yourself a few lesser metamagic rods and go to town.

Readying Scrolls
----------------

A scroll must be seen and read - not necessarily held. This means that a wizard with [unseen servant](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/u/unseen-servant)  can have it pull scrolls from a backpack or other source and hold them up, while the wizard himself keeps his hands full (for example, with a staff and scroll blade).

A [handy haversack](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bag-handy-haversack) lets you draw a scroll from it as a move action, without provoking an attack of opportunity. An _unseen servant_ cannot be attacked except by ranged attacks, so it would not provoke in any case.

Steal/Disarm/Dispel
-------------------

Scrolls are as vulnerable to disarm and steal actions as anything else a wizard holds. What can be done to improve the wizard's CMD?

As supernatural abilities, Scroll Blade and Scroll Shield [cannot be dispelled or countered](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-). However, it might be possible for _dispel magic_ to suppress the magic of the scrolls like a magic item.
