# Time Travel

This is an attempt to describe the physics and mechanics of a time travel system that should be playable in a typical RPG. It allows room for player freedom while also keeping the GM's headaches to a minimum.

Glossary
--------

Time is often described as a river. The terms used here will follow suit.

* Oxbow - an isolated chunk of reality created by reverting changes in history.
* Tributary - an "alternate timestream", "parallel history", or many other terms. In short, an attempt to divert the flow of events along a different path.
* Trunk - "the flow of time" as most people understand it. The history of the world as seen from a typical observer's vantage point.

Assumptions
-----------

There is an "arrow of time" in the universe - a reason why we move forward in time, but not backward. The cause of this is called "temporal gravity" - the mass of the universe in our future is what pulls us forward to meet it.

Time travel is the act of accelerating through the time dimension, either "up" toward the past, or "down" toward the future.

Think of time not as a single line of events, but as a complicated braid of threads woven together. The "trunk" of time - that is, the way that most events turn out - is relatively fixed. But "tributaries" can emerge, when someone changes existing history.

What happens when I change history?
-----------------------------------

It works. But it may not last.

"Plastic time" is in effect. This means that events which can converge in both histories will tend to do so. If they can completely join together, then history after that point continues on only one course.

The human brain is sensitive to quantum events. When a tributary of time is created, the particles of the separated universe remain entangled, and can influence each other. People will have flashes of insight, subconscious instincts, or strongly-felt impulses that make them take actions which will reconcile the events of the two separated timelines.

One of two things can happen at this point:

1. The timelines eventually converge. If you go back in time to get Bob to buy Subway for lunch instead of Applebee's, the resulting tributary will probably return to the trunk very quickly. On the other hand, if you kill Winston Churchill, it might be hundreds of years before history can right itself. Or it may not, in which case...
2. The timelines snap apart. A new history has been created, and unless changed by someone else's actions, will remain as a new trunk of time. Left alone, this new trunk will create an "oxbow timeline" - a potential history - of the old events.

If you travel forward, you will always see the events that would play out if your changes had happened. You've become part of the new sequence of events.

Can I change history back?
--------------------------

You can. But it may not be easy.

You can stop the original individual (even yourself) from changing events, using anything from persuasion to blackmail to physical intervention.

You can take steps that makes the newly-created tributary easier to converge, thus erasing the long-term consequences of the change. Maybe Winston Churchill is dead, but you were able to find a similarly charismatic and well-positioned leader to take his place. In this case, history will tend to right itself as soon as it is able.

If someone else travels in time, what do they see?
--------------------------------------------------

They see the past (or the future, depending on direction) of whatever trunk or tributary they left from. For example, a traveler from the future where Churchill was killed would see his murder if he went to the appropriate time.

If you are a time agent from the future where Churchill lived, and you leave for the future after he gets killed, he'll still have been killed in whatever future you land in. The same goes for someone leaving from (say) 1200 BC. The only people who can still observe the old unchanged history are those who are still traveling within the old trunk.
