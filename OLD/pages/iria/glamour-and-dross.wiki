= Glamour and Dross =

'''Glamour and Dross''' are two aspects of the same energy: the power of magic.  Glamour is the creative, living, chaotic force; Dross is the stabilizing, decaying, calming force.  Glamour is native to [[The Other]], while Dross is native to Iria.

Each material can be harvested by subjecting its homeworld to its opposite element; for example, a small amount of Glamour can be used in a magical ritual to form Dross.

Dross is highly coveted by [[The Courts]] and other inhabitants of the Other, while Glamour is the basis for all spellcasting and magical power.  [[Vores]] are often hunted for the trace amounts of Glamour which can be harvested from their bodies.
