Absolution's purpose is to defend imperial property from "heretics" - people who condemn the empire's technological ambitions and methods.  [[Separatist Cults]], anti-technology wizards, and other unreformed temples (in the empire's judgment) are all watched closely by Absolution.  The order does not proactively attack such groups.  Instead, it protects technological installations and imperial temples.
