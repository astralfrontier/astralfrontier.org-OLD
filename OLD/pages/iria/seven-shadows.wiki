The '''Seven Shadows''' is an international organized crime ring.  They are not killers or assassins, although they have no compunction about murder in their line of work.  Instead, they promote gambling, vice, and other pursuits.

They operate secretly in most major cities and law-abiding nations, and more openly in the country and in free-wheeling nations.  In some places they are the only effective law.  Their methods are harsh but equitable, and the magistrates and police will sometimes cooperate with an "uncle" of the Seven Shadows to bring in a more dangerous criminal.

A key tenet of Seven Shadows criminal activity is "the customer comes to us" - while they facilitate vice, gambling, drugs, and so forth, they avoid burglary and kidnapping.
