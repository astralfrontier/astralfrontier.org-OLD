= Imperial Cartographic Charter =

The '''Imperial Cartographic Charter''' of [[Malvet]] is a government-sponsored group of explorers and travelers.  Their purpose is to accurately reconstruct maps of the ancient world, in the hope of unlocking the secrets of [[Geomancy]] that are locked inside [[Zoa]]'s writing system.

The ICC is willing to hire adventurers and travelers, and will pay handsomely for confirmed information about other lands.  They frequently find themselves in dangerous parts of the world.
