'''Summoners''' are a special breed of divine spellcaster.  After the habitation of the Dragon's Nest by draconic [[Vores]] and other monsters, the regional priests petitioned their [[The Courts|Courts]] for assistance.  The Courts answered by giving their clerics the ability to call forth powerful avatar Vores of their own, who would do battle with the dragons as necessary.

Summoners have become the only effective law in the anarchic Dragon's Nest.  They are not often found outside of the archipelago, but a few are called on to travel and use their special gifts.
