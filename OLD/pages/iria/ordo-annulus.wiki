The '''Ordo Annulus''', or "Order of the Ring", is a fraternal organization of arcane spellcasters and scholars interested in the topic of [[Geomancy]].  Unlike groups such as Malvet's Cartography Charter, they concern themselves with contemporary geomancy rather than trying to explore the [[Zoa]]-era flows of energy.

The Order publishes an annual digest of its members' researches, entitled "Findings on Orbits and Concurrences".  The Order also maintains a considerable amount of secret information, usually available for a fee and a declaration of purpose.  The intent is to allow national governments, temples, and other such groups share the Order's knowledge, while keeping it out of the hands of individual wizards.

The Order serves primarily as a source of information.  Wizards with an interest in geomancy can contribute their own research to the Order's library.  With enough access (or enough money), they can also look up interesting information.  And of course anyone with access to a major library can consult back issues of the "Findings".
