The empire of '''Malvet''' is aggressive and mechanistic.  They reject "conservative" religious teachings about "the artifice of man" being a condemnation of all technology.  They believe that mechanistry of the terrestrial or elemental spheres is acceptable, such as gunpowder and steam engines.

== History ==

Malvet was formed more than two centuries ago by three heroes and their army of followers.  Acting on the advice of a learned sage, they found a forested plateau nestled between three mountain ranges and began settling there.  The area was abundant in coal and wood, and the soil could be tilled for crops.

The trio of founders discovered something else, of course.  The sage had suspected that ruins from the [[Zoa]] epoch could be found there, and so they were.  After some excavation, the people of the mountain country began unlocking the ancient secrets of mechanistry.  They fought off numerous [[Vores]], who had been reproducing and infesting the region.  They laid roads and fortified the mountain passes leading out of the area.
