The '''Ouroboros''' Church is a heretical sect (from the perspective of the mainstream temples).  It preaches that just as there are cycles of existence on Iria, the Iria-Other relationship is itself also a cycle.  The creatures of the Other are the reborn souls of natural life, and the those creatures will in turn eventually reincarnate into men and animals.

The Church claims the ability to identify certain people as "sacred reincarnations" of powerful Other beings, and likewise claims that many of the 'gods' of the Other are reincarnated "saints".  Several living Saints exist, and the Church protects them with its knights and paladins.
