I'm a professional software development engineer. You can view my latest résumé online: [resume.pdf](/assets/resume.pdf)

### Github and open source

My github URL: [@astralfrontier](https://github.com/astralfrontier)

As of right now (2016), I'm working with the following technologies:

* **Languages**: I'm using [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/),
  with [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) as my language of choice.
  I've been learning [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
* **Web development**: I'm using [Koa](http://koajs.com/) for web serving,
  and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) for the front-end UI.
* **Storage**: [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com/) is my NoSQL engine of choice.
* **Libraries**: [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/) for functional JS programming.

I'm using a tool called [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) to build my static websites.
I've contributed Metalsmith plugins as well:

* I contributed a patch to davidxmoody's [metalsmith-broken-link-checker](https://github.com/davidxmoody/metalsmith-broken-link-checker) plugin,
  to conform to HTML5 anchor behaviors.
* I wrote [metalsmith-open-graph](https://github.com/astralfrontier/metalsmith-open-graph) to write Facebook OpenGraph attributes to a page.
* I wrote [metalsmith-yaml](https://github.com/astralfrontier/metalsmith-yaml) to parse YAML source files as content.

Two of my websites are built using Metalsmith and served via AWS's S3 service:

* [astralfrontier.org](http://astralfrontier.org) ([GitHub project page](https://github.com/astralfrontier/astralfrontier.org))
* [peppermile.com](http://peppermile.com) ([GitHub project page](https://github.com/astralfrontier/peppermile.org))

### Salesforce

I develop with Salesforce at work.
To make things easier to develop SFDC apps,
I wrote a framework called [Claire](https://github.com/astralfrontier/claire).
It's a build system and template for writing Javascript one-page apps served as Visualforce pages.

A sample Claire app is also available, called [SOAR](https://github.com/astralfrontier/soar),
or "Save Our Admin Resources".
This tool lets you inspect object schemas, look at field permissions,
run SOQL queries, and other simple administrative functions.
