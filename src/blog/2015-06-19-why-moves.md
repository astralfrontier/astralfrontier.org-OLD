Writing the long-delayed, much-changed Vessels game has led me back,
again and again, to the model used by Apocalypse World and Dungeon World:
"moves".

In short, a move is a piece of mechanics that embeds itself into the ongoing
stream of fiction. "When X happens during the storytelling part, rule Y
asserts itself." Usually this is a simple roll-to-succeed situation,
where success means you get to proceed as though X worked out, failure
means X doesn't, and somewhere in the middle is X working out but
with contingent condition Z tacked on. "When I throw a grenade, I either
blow up the other guy, blow myself up, or blow up the other guy but
get shot by his buddies" is an example of this success-fail-complicate
triad.

I like success-fail-complicate. I'm not a big fan of success-fail, and
also not a fan of success-complicate. Some tasks should be too big and
too hard to realistically tackle. There's an endless number of ways to
implement SFC using dice, cards, or computers, but they are all
roughly equivalent in creative cost. You can spend the same several hours
muddling out one dice system as you can a different one.

Why moves suck
--------------

I *like* moves, but I have a hard time writing a game that demands that
I author a *lot* of moves. It's simply a log, painful slog through
creative writing, and at the end I don't have any confidence that
everything is tested and balanced and fun. For that, I'd need to go
play-test it all, and that's time I could be spending writing more
moves, or the next game, or whatever.

I bit off a big chunk when writing the PC traits rules for Vessels.
Characters don't have a "class", they have traits: identity,
ideals, experiences, and sacrifices. Each of these traits comes
with one or more moves, called "Gambits", unlocked when the PC
brings that trait into play.
For example, an honorable knight has an honor-related
move that he can start using once honor is put on the table.
There is no "level" or "XP" - you have access to everything you
can do, depending how much you open your heart to the crisis at hand.

Why moves are awesome
---------------------

In theory this is good for creating wildly variable characters.
I believe in practice it'll be a huge amount of work,
because every type of trait needs 6-12 values, or more,
and that's 35-40 moves to write in total. But if I do that work,
you can play whatever you like, and I'll at least be somewhat
prepared for you, because at bottom there's a short and finite
number of things you do in this game (manage emotion, bonds,
fates, and heart) and Gambits are mainly there to give you new
and exciting angles for how to tackle those tasks.

You can have the Honorable Knight from the Last War who Lost His
True Love, or the Honorable Merchant from the City who Lost His
Love, and those characters will have as many similarities as
differences. But those two guys alone have 6 unique Gambits
between them, and there's only so much in the game that needs
a rule for it.

Why moves aren't Gambits
------------------------

How does this stack against a typical DW playbook? The
Gambits of the Vessels rules are complex compared to one-liner
DW moves, but a typical DW playbook might have 25 total moves on it,
maybe 10-15 of which are in play with a high-level character.

This might be an argument in favor of simplifying Gambits,
doing away with the baroque dice system, and just using
2d6 like DW does. But my system does something that 2d6
doesn't, and maybe I need to be convinced that that thing
isn't valuable before I can accept giving it up.
Gambits are - or *can be* - complex because the baroque system gives me
options that 2d6 doesn't have, and I exploit that complexity.

What next
---------

I tried to solve the problem of writing a lot of Gambits by
packaging them into stories, like the fairy tales and fables of
the fictional world - there's heroic characters and dastardly
villains, and there's a moral, and reading those stories should
suggest ideals, identity, experience, and sacrifice. Each of
the stories should suggest Gambits, which is how in general
the protagonists managed to make it through.

This has the dual advantage of validating my proposed game rules
against an acceptable metric: heroic fiction. Rather than writing
rules in a vacuum, I'm extracting them directly from a story that I
already know has some interesting qualities. This is extra
creative work, but it neatly compartmentalizes a very large
task.
