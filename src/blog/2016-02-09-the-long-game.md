Based on a thread on Google+,
I decided to talk about the factors that I think can
make or break a long-running roleplaying campaign.
I also want to talk about suggestions for how to plant the seeds
for such a game, and how to nurture it as it grows.

### Getting Started

You need two things:
a ''long-term premise'' and ''player investment''.

The premise isn't the superficial plot.
It's not "elves vs. orcs" or "everyone plays demons".
It's the seed that creates new stories
once old ones are finished, or have become boring.
Sometimes this is a theme, like "fantasy racism"
or "free will vs. determinism".
Sometimes it's an approach to the game, like
"roll dice, kill monsters, take their stuff, have fun".

Player investment is how eager your players are to play any long-running game,
as well as to play yours specifically.

Explain your premise, and then ask people,
"so do you want to play a long-running game about X?"
Don't settle for just "yes".
People are agreeable. People go along with what they think the group wants.
If you hear "yes", ask the followup: "what interests you about X?"
Get an answer that makes sense.
The level of detail you got will tell you how invested they are in the idea.
You'll also get ideas for how to proceed with the game.

### Player Presence and Online vs. Face-to-Face

There's four general modes of play:

1. Face-to-face gaming at regular intervals, e.g. 3 hours every 2 weeks.
2. Real-time gaming via Google Hangouts, Skype, video chat, etc.
3. Real-time text-based gaming.
4. Play-by-post.

None of them automatically makes your campaign more or less likely
to last a long time. Instead, your players' schedules dictate which one is best.

For example, I'm in a face-to-face game in real life.
It lasts 3-4 hours every two weeks, but it's three more hours just
to get there and back.
That's three hours of my day I don't get back,
which means I'm less likely to want this to continue for years.
On the other hand, I can look around the table and immediately
gauge body language, "condensing fact from the vapor of nuance",
to get a feeling for what people are doing next, how they feel about
what I am doing, and so forth.

I'm in a Hangouts game expected to run for a few Saturdays.
There's no travel time, but it's hard to really get a read on my
fellow players. I can see their faces when they talk,
but there's a feeling of separation at times.

I'm running a real-time text game for a small group, as practice with
the Fate system.
It's very difficult to get an idea of what people are thinking if they don't say it,
and a few times I've had to clear up a misunderstanding.
But I can do other things while that game is going on,
like thumbing through the Atomic Robo comic for inspiration.

Finally, I'm running a play-by-post supers game.
It can drag on at times.
One of my players posts maybe once or twice a week at times,
more often saying "sorry guys work is very busy"
rather than just allowing the plot to move forward,
and things have been arranged in such a way that his character
is central to a few scenes.
It's been going for a year, and only recently did the group finish
their first real day on this new alien planet.
But there's plenty of time between posts to talk about approaches,
hammer out new plot ideas, and ask questions that don't disturb the rest of the group.

The choice of venue depends largely on your players and their schedules.
Busy parents or professionals appreciate not having their time wasted,
which often means a video chat rather than a face-to-face game.
Thoughtful or introverted players can get more value out of a text game.

### The First Story

Long campaigns are made up of shorter stories.
Good stories have payoffs.
When your first story reaches one, it will be tempting for your players
to feel that closure and interpret it as the end of the game.
Interest might start to flag.

Before your first story reaches its climactic ending,
try to have planted seeds for the next one.
Alternately, make your story's ending logically suggest the start of another.

For example, the adventuring party has rescued a kidnapped elven princess
as their first story. Returning her to the castle feels like denouement.
But is that where she wants to be? Is she going to be safe there?
Is she in an unhappy arranged marriage? Has she fallen for one of the PCs?

Take this approach in moderation.
Your campaign can't run at fourth gear all the time.
The game needs breaks, slow times, and breather moments.
But always give the group something to look forward to.

### Keeping Track of Details

The more details matter to your game, the more likely you are to want a
tool to keep track of them.
Shared documents courtesy of Google Docs, DropBox, Evernote, or Wikia
can all help players keep track of important things.

Wherever possible, there should be a space where every player
can post something or edit what's already present.
The players will naturally keep track of the things that are important to them.
Letting players write original material pushes some of the weight of
world-building off of your shoulders, which is good.

You should strive for consistency in the things that matter,
and be willing to retcon old events for the sake of keeping the game going.
If something is important to you later,
write it down.

Similarly, not every idea will be good immediately.
Write down your ideas for the future in your document storage system.
Leaf through them every so often,
or share some of them with the players to see what sounds interesting.

### Role Models for Long Campaigns

J. Michael Straczynski famously wrote his seminal television series "Babylon 5"
in a way that long-running games can emulate.
You can read more about it [here](http://io9.gizmodo.com/5985727/the-strange-secret-evolution-of-babylon-5).

First, he had a solid set of criteria, and a clear long-term premise:
"do for sci-fi television what Hill Street Blues did for cop shows".
No cute robots, no kids.

Second, each of his story elements were written with some internal tension.
Individual characters had rivals, superiors, problems, and plans.
A single external menace, such as the Shadows in later seasons,
could represent different things to different characters.
They were a military or social conflict for Sheridan,
but essentially a moral conflict for characters like Londo Mollari.

Third, JMS structured his stories in ways
that would survive changes in production,
such as an actor leaving the show.
Many of these "trap doors" came from the internal tensions
that had already been established.

A famous military general said,
"I made all my plans out of rope. When something broke, I tied a knot."
You should be prepared for your plans to change.
Players come and go, or don't show up.
Characters that are crucial to the plot wander off or do something else.
Don't pin too much weight on a single player.
Have contingencies ready if the players surprise you.

### Final Thoughts

Small costs add up over the long term.

Respect your players' time and preferences,
and they'll be willing to come back again and again.
The time we spend in your game is a cost, so make it cheap for us.

Give them an idea worth following,
and permission to build on the back of it,
and they will feel personally invested in making your game continue.
The effort to care about your world is much less
if it's our world too, so make it open to us.

Finally,
your game may end with a different set of players,
and a different direction,
than you started with.
This is okay.
Surviving big changes is the real hallmark of a long-running game.
