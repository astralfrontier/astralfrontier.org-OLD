Political posts don't normally appear in this space.
But almost everybody I know has expressed fear about a Donald Trump presidency.
That fear separates itself into a series of questions about RPGs and similar hobbies.
I want to answer those questions for myself,
plus an additional and important one: "Why do we play role-playing games?"

### Why do we play role-playing games?



### Can I have fun?

I can't give a voice to anyone else's interior world, but in mine,
the first question is this:
"Am I allowed to have fun in a Trump presidency?"
Am I betraying my principles, my friends, or my country if I have fun?
Shouldn't I be out being a political activist?
Shouldn't I be donating my time and attention to "real", or at least more worthy, causes?
Am I slacking off if I'm not out there on the streets being hosed down by the fuzz?

During World War 1, the [Christmas truce] of 1914 was a break from the fighting.
Soldiers of opposing armies would stop firing.
They did something out of character for wartime: they'd talk to the enemy.
Some exchanged personal effects.
There was even a football game.
Of course the brass came down on them hard, and the horrors of war followed.
But for that year of the war, humanity prevailed.

Historian Tony Ashworth gave this explanation:
the system "gave soldiers some control over the conditions of their existence."
We have to give ourselves the same control.
We can't let ourselves be defined by the opposition,
even if our actions are in protest to it.

### Will RPGs be fun?

Sometimes we play games for catharsis ("I just want to blow stuff up").
Other times we play for immersion ("")
Role-playing games often reflect our hopes and fears.
If we spend time thinking about something,
it's natural that our hobbies will reflect that.
