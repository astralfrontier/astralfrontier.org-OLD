A couple of groups have already playtested [Inept Sorcerers]
and the feedback was apparently good! Based on that, I am moving
forward to gussy it up a bit - adding art, doing better layout,
and so forth.

If you are interested in discussing the game, I've got a new
phpBB forum installed here:
[http://forum.astralfrontier.org/](http://forum.astralfrontier.org/)

Register for an account - it'll require you to follow an activation
link sent via email - and let me know what you think of the game,
what you'd like it to do, or anything else.
