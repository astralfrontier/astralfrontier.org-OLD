There's a corpse laying in the crossroads. This isn't unusual in the Plaguelands, or even in Tirisfal Glades, where two black-cloaked travelers came across it. The unusual part is the half-empty bottle of wine clutched in its desiccated hand.

Karl is surveying the corpse warily, his hand resting lightly on the hilt of the sword that hides beneath his dark cloak. His companion Jordan is looking through his wizards' enchanted spectacles at the horizon: the ruined spires of Lordaeron, marking the Forsaken capital.

"They say Sylvanas Windrunner has finally approved of this new religion the undead have developed,"  Jordan says, half to himself. "The one where they resurrect the dead... Hmm, the Banshee Queen, alive again?"

Karl is more interested in the corpse immediately in front of them. He prods it gently with his boot. "So what do you think," he finally asks, in a tense whisper.

The mage barely hears it. "She's very interesting. Sure, she has that whole 'queen of the undead' thing going on..."

Karl sighs. "What about the body?"

"Great body," continues his companion, a little dreamily.

Karl snaps. "The DEAD body," he shouts, forcibly dragging Jordan closer to stare at the corpse on the road.

Both men startle when the 'corpse' begins to move. Its words are slurred, but they finally make out what it's trying to say. "Never drinking that much again."

Karl finally makes the connection. "You're.. Forsaken?"

The undead creature blinks owlishly at the pair, finally forming coherent words after a moment of hesitation. "Yeah, guess I am. Welcome to Tirisfal Glades. You musht be the living."

"Wait. What were you drinking?" Jordan asks.

The Forsaken achieves its goal of standing with only a few minor stumbles. "Wine," it slurs, and waves the bottle around for emphasis. "What does thish look like?"

"How?" Karl asks.

The undead creature chortles. It's an unpleasant noise to human ears. "By being like you for a night. By being alive."

Jordan and Karl just stare at each other.

Undercity remains unwholesome for the living, but the pair are unmolested as they pass through its gates. The dark sentinels of the Forsaken watch from their shadows, and the abnormally oversized and misproportioned rats of the sewers scuttle to and fro to avoid their armored footfalls. The living humans find an escort seemingly materializing around them - half a dozen armed cadavers dressed in the finest armor the looted graves of Lordaeron have to offer. They pass by the grotesque creatures called "abominations" who stand guard at the inner doors. They traverse the Undercity itself, once merely the sewers and basements and dungeons of Lordaeron's capital.

Jordan and Karl can see the living here and there - orcs, trolls, and other creatures associated with the Horde or enjoying its protection. A few wary looks are exchanged, but neither side seems interested in provoking the other.

The throne room of the Banshee Queen comes at the end of a dizzying descent into the earth, past what Karl's trained eyes recognize as a series of murder holes. Her advisors and the generals of her armies are here, but the woman herself does not participate in the gaudy finery of human royalty. She wears little indeed, but that needed to support herself as an archer - leather gloves, straps, and bandoliers for her bow, arrows, and other equipment. Jordan catches his breath. Karl quietly sighs at his enamored companion.

The Forsaken majordomo steps forward on the queen's dais, and introduces the pair. They have been expected, at least. "Jordan Mistborn of Dalaran, mage. Karl Kromley, Dalaran warder."

Jordan bows and speaks. "We received the summons from Undercity, your majesty. A wizard capable of opening a portal to Stormwind, with the access codes to enter through their wards. Safe passage to be guaranteed by a hostage. Dalaran received your emissary. May I report that he is safe and sound."

"That is well." Sylvanas' voice carries through the room with practiced ease, the air of authority and the hint of menace present as always. "Your task is to open a portal. Our counterparts in Stormwind will be expecting this. We will be receiving a guest. Once he has safely arrived, your task will be complete, and Dalaran will have the gratitude of the Undercity."

Jordan blinks and looks about him. "May, er, may I ask the nature of your business with Stormwind? I realize there are state secrets and all, but I admit a great deal of personal curiosity. Your majesty."

Sylvanas curls her lip in amusement. "My plan will cause a great deal of confusion and consternation in Dalaran. For that reason I will tell you. I intend to provide this dark kingdom of the Forsaken with.. an heir."

Jordan almost falls over. Only Karl's sudden grip on his shoulders keep him upright. "An.... an heir?" he squeaks.

In response, the Banshee queen runs a hand languidly up her hip, then lifts it to touch her lips with one fingertip. "You don't approve of the union between humans and elves, Master Mistborn?" she asks in a voice dripping with innocence.

Karl sighs, speaking now that his charge has lost all capacity for rational thought. "We'll be at your disposal, ma'am," he explains wearily. "In the meantime, may we rest and eat somewhere?"

The majordomo gestures; the escort squad turn. "You'll be taken to accommodations suitable for the living. Please speak to one of the attendants there for any of your needs."

Karl hauls Jordan back up the corridor, flanked by the undead, away from the sound of Sylvanas' low, amused laughter.

As the humans depart, the majordomo moves to Sylvanas' side.

"My lady, I of course serve you and will not question your actions," he whispers. "I simply wish to tell you that there is some dissent in the Undercity."

"When is there *not* dissent?" replies Sylvanas mockingly. "Or do you forget the coup attempt? Even now I'm forced to use the Sacred Fire as insurance against the Apothecaries. Only Ezra's disciples may work with the Plague, and always with some of their own in human form present. If they are diligent at all times, their fellows won't die accidentally. That keeps them too busy to plot anything further."

"The Forgotten Shadow worries about their position," the majordomo continues. "They still see the Sacred Fire as dangerous. For you to take a side in their feud may spark rebellion."

The queen sighs. "The Forsaken as a whole must survive me. The coup gave me much to think on. Without me, Varimathras would have taken over. Without him -- well, others would have tried. A strong successor allows me to carry out my will from beyond my final grave."

The majordomo frowns. "But to actually bear a child? A living child? Will the Forsaken accept a living ruler?"

Sylvanas smiles. "I don't know. Half-dead perhaps, or able to change like you. If he is merely alive, well, there is always the Plague."

The Forsaken majordomo swallows, in a mouth without saliva. He's not sure whether his queen is joking or not, and sees no point in asking to be sure. He changes tactics. "What of those who say that Ezra himself should join you on the throne?"

The queen, facing away from the man and staring thoughtfully across her throne room, actually laughs at this. "Ezra is a devoted follower, but he is far too independent to sit his backside on a throne for long, and far too rebellious to make the sacrifices a ruler requires. Nor would he take me as queen. I think he still carries a torch, if you'll pardon my saying so, for his living wife. And in my estimation, she'd be a fool to let him go so easily. No, he remains a useful free agent. On this I'm sure he would agree."

A familiar chuckle makes Sylvanas startle and turn. The majordomo has gone - *curse him, he conjured the man himself while I wasn't looking to play a trick on me*, she thinks - and in his place is a black-coated Forsaken who tips his hat politely in greeting.

"I cannot comment on my love life, or lack thereof," Ezra remarks sardonically. "But from my ssummonsss, I pressume Dalaran's emisssariess have come and that portal preparations are made. May I alsso compliment your majesty on her choice of conssort."

"You come and go very freely, Master Pyreborn." The queen smirks. "But even ghosts know their place before the Banshee Queen. Go prepare yourself for the arrival of our guest. I have decided to renovate the chapel above. We shall have a wedding in the human style after all. But if you would be so kind to officiate as minister, I doubt the congregation will be in much of a position to object."

"It shall be done, your majesty." Ezra disappears in a blast of sand, leaving behind the majordomo. He too bows and takes his leave, and the queen remains behind, wrapped in silent thought.

TODO: Grayson Shadowbreaker

The chapel is a study in contrasts. Pews for the guests are aligned with the high windows; the sunlight bathes half the guests in its glow, and leaves the other half in shadow. The living and the dead sit apart from each other, equally represented. High-ranking apothecaries, nobles of Undercity and former nobles from Lordaeron, influential merchant princes and masters of magic show the face of the Undercity. Opposite them are members of the Alliance and the Horde - humans, dwarves, tauren, orcs, and even a few trolls and one or two elves of uncertain affiliation.

Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker stands by the altar, helm in hand, otherwise clad in the full regalia of his noble station. Over his shining armor, he wears a tabard. Not the bright colors of Stormwind, but the more subdued heraldry of the Order of the Silver Hand. Nearby are other members of the paladin orders of Stormwind, dressed no less finely, come to honor their leader and champion. Behind the altar, Ezra wears unadorned black robes and spotless white bandages over his burn-scarred skin. He comes not to be honored, but to perform a rite in his capacity as religious leader, and dresses the part.

The planners of the ceremony know their craft well. Enough time is given to the prelude to build anticipation, but not spill into impatience. At just the right moment, the back doors of the chapel swing open. And the music begins.

It is solemn, but not melancholy. It is subdued, but not lonely. At first it is percussion and woodwind and strings. As the bride appears in the door and glides forward to stand beside her consort, her banshee bridesmaids begin to give words to the feelings built up in the chapel.

> Here, hold my breath

The bride is concealed all in black, with layers of veils atop an elegant if gothic dress. She begins to divest herself of it, revealing glowing eyes and preserved undead flesh beneath.

> Feel the tremble I know best

Carefully she reaches out her hand, guiding it toward Grayson. His hesitation is momentary; the pair's fingers brush together as they first look each other eye to eye.

> The fear in my mind is the echo in my heart

The Banshee Queen bows her head a moment. Even the paladin cannot completely hide his uncertainty, despite everything that's riding on him today. But both rally, and turn to look to Ezra.

> Cold and plain

Sylvanas' hand is the first to withdraw. A faint black aura of magic surrounds her body; like the darkness before the dawn, the spectral aura gives way to a brilliant flaming hue.

> As you watch me

Lord Grayson raises a hand to shield his eyes. Many of those in the audience do the same; not everyone has seen a new initiate of the Sacred Fire unleash their power.

> Fall apart

Sylvanas' body dissolves into sand. For a brief moment, yellow and white lights shine faintly through the sand mass. But it doesn't last long. She resumes the humanoid shape... just not her old one.

> These tears are warmer than the sun

Before the audience, before the paladins of Stormwind, a living high elf stands. Her hair is jet black - like Ezra's baldness, not even this magic can fully free one from the marks of undeath - but her skin is lustrous. Her eyes are the pale luminescence of the elves, not the unnatural glow of the Forsaken. And tears roll down her cheeks, reflecting and altering that glow, giving her skin a magical sparkle. And she smiles, showing healthy white teeth. She chokes for a moment, breath caught in her throat - breath, after so long - and the tears flow unimpeded.

> These tears are warmer than the sun

Not even the acolytes of the Forgotten Shadow can muster the resolve to deny their queen in this moment. Whatever the difficulties this choice will bring her, for the moment, the Forsaken marvel that their beloved queen looks so uncharacteristically *happy*.

> The heart I share with you may be manic or diseased but always true

Nor is Grayson Shadowbreaker reluctant to embrace this change. His hands are the ones to reach first this time, finding Sylvanas' newly warm fingers and meshing with them.

> If you keep me here you can chase away this pain...

The queen does more than settle for this. She steps closer, taking the paladin's arm for her own and nestling close as the pair stand before the altar to be recognized.

> I'm warm again and in your light I'll stay

The paladin positively glows, and his queen glows with him. Nor is this a mere turn of phrase. The attendees can see the Light itself present - the power of the soul shining forth - and know that the Light accepts even their queen, for now.

> These tears are warmer than the sun

The Banshee Queen has been alive for three months. Her physicians have kept a careful watch on her life, and on one other. She has received visitors no less distinguished than Hamuul Runetotem, who traveled all the way from Thunder Bluff to witness this miracle. The ancient Archdruid departed on uncertain terms once he heard the Queen's promise to her people that her heir would be "both living and dead, both human and elf," and how she would keep the promise of "being dead".

Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker has worked hard to be a friend to the Forsaken. He travels among them, not as a missionary of the Light, but as the consort of their beloved queen. He tells stories of Stormwind and the kingdoms of the living. He asks questions of the free-willed undead, of their history and disposition. He seems interested in their opinions. Such is his charisma that only a few find some of his questions suspicious, such as those concerning the fate of Grand Marshal Othmar Garithos.

The strife within the Forsaken has become something acceptable, even normal. Those who speak out against the living are not punished unless they act on their beliefs. More and more Forsaken are learning the Sacred Fire and adopting a human identity again. They live aboveground, slowly returning Tirisfal Glades to a livable state. The ravages of plague and war have left their toll on the land; more than a few settlers have found themselves forced back into the undead state to avoid hunger.

...

The announcement of a new Plague variant brings the royal entourage to view a demonstration - from a safe distance, according to the assurances of the (still living) Apothecaries who bring the news. The Queen and Consort are brought to a sealed-off chamber and placed inside for the duration of the test, while outside the Forsaken alchemists have brought a variety of hostile creatures into a pit where the Plague will be demonstrated.

Sylvanas watches with faint amusement, while Grayson watches with abject horror, as wolves, bears, and other living animals fall prey to the green death. All the while, the Forsaken technicians move freely throughout the testing area, and Forsaken observers are welcomed from the crowd into the pit. Whatever this new formulation, it seems the undead are immune.

Perhaps signs of the Dark Lady's fatigue were what signaled the attack. Perhaps it was all pre-arranged. But the "sealed-off observation chamber" may also serve as a deathtrap. "Death to the living!" is the call, and suddenly vials of the very same Plague are ejected from hidden ports in the ceiling. As a paladin, Lord Shadowbreaker has exhibited a personal immunity to such things in the past. What of his Queen?

Sylvanas has only a moment. Her skills as a dark ranger, her savant's mastery of the bow, her agility and reflexes, are all useless against this attack. Through the glass, the brief hand on her belly signal all too well her fleeting thoughts in that fraction of a second. Only Grayson hears her anguished cry as she pays for her own life with the sacrifice of another and erupts into a cloud of sand.

The Apothecaries outside hear the sound of shattering glass. The undead Banshee Queen steps out of the wreckage of the sealed chamber, a lambent Grayson at her side, her bow and arrows at the ready. Mercilessly she aims and fires, taking Forsaken down as they attempt to flee. A few simply cast themselves to the ground in terror. These she spares for the moment, walking over their prostrate forms in her search for outlets for her wrath.

Many of the Apothecaries, and the rest of the observers, reacted with motionless shock to the initial attack. These, along with those who threw themselves on their Queen's mercy, are herded together by armed Deathguards.
