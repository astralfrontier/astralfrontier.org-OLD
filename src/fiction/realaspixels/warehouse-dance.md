title: Warehouse Dance
synopsis: One snowy night.
---

I met Shinobu in the snow outside the warehouse, as she mingled with the rest of the packed crowd waiting to get inside. She wore a green hoodie, anonymous among the throng. I smiled at her, and wondered if she remembered me. But I wouldn't know until we were finally admitted.

The glass-enclosed booth near the door was for tickets. Admission to the event was free, but special services were always available at a premium. The woman inside, one of the temporary autonomous zone's staff, smiled afresh at each new man who approached the booth. There was music, and dancing, connecting people with their primal natures for as long as the moon reigned.

I saw the man in front of me drop a Benjamin and receive a ticket in trade. What had he just bought for himself? It was my turn to know.

"I'm here for.." I began, hoping the ticket-mistress would supply the rest. She did. "Shinobu."

"Yeah," I smiled. Five twenties came out of my pocket and were slipped through the glass barrier.

The darkness outside was being kept at bay, as it must be every night. The pale snow on the ground reflected purity; there were no gaudy lights or pyrotechnics. The air was saturated with the music. Hormones in the brain and the bloodstream twisted the universe beyond into something fantastic, working that ancient and ephemeral magic, the dreaming glamour, for as long as the dancers could sustain themselves.

I was to be Shinobu's last dance. I saw some of the girls leaving - it was late, and their partners were leaving too. The dance would resume elsewhere.

Shinobu emerged from the crowd, a creature lithely stalking among the crowd. Was she the hunter or prey? When she was younger, I had thought myself as her protector and guardian. Now she was grown, and confident. I prayed she knew what she was doing. I prayed that I did.

My ticket is in my hand. She takes it, slides it into her pocket. She's still wearing the hoodie. We dance, orbiting each other, marionettes pulling each others' strings, our eyes and our smiles negotiating a constantly changing bargain. Her motions are an art form etched in afterimages on my eyes. My mind is unmoored from my memories, my doubts. Past and future no longer exist; the moment is too insistent to permit such fancies.

What will become of me? I care not.
