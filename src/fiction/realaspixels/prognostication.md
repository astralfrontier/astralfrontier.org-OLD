title: Prognostication
synopsis: How to see the future.
---

Every year the inhabitants of the castle gather for the prognostication. The oracles consult the signs and read the omens. The culmination of their esoteric practice is reserved for the last day of the year: New Year's Eve.

"A day is as a year," they will tell you if asked. "As above, so below," some will intone. The message is the same: whatever happens on that day, be it good or ill, heralds the condition of the coming year.

Man has always been fascinated with destiny. On some New Years Eves, madmen or the desperate would attempt to change this fate: hurling themselves in the way of boulders or floods to bring about an ill fate, or doing great deeds in the hope that their heroism would resonate through the oncoming annum. To date, nothing definite can be said about their success.
