synopsis: The virtue of simplicity.

Tao can sometimes be found in the Castle, but just as often he's living in his house. It's an enormous place, so large one could get lost in it.

When Tao was younger, he was a wealthy man courtesy of his grandfather's estate, and he bought a large house. He bought many things and put them in the house, reckoning that in the future he'd have need of them. He bought sports equipment, books, and sculptures. He said to himself, "I will surely want to exercise my body, and exercise my mind, and exercise my soul".

His friends would come to visit, and he would show them his possessions. But none of his friends liked sports, or books, or sculptures, for they had come to see him as a friend. He could not offer them friendship, for he was so disappointed that his wisely-gathered possessions were of no value to them. He would say, "have I nothing to offer you here?" and his friends would sadly leave.

He used the sports equipment for a time, but discovered he liked long brisk walks on the path around his house even more. So he gave it away. And he read the books, but discovered that meditation and conversation enlightened him more. So he gave them away. And he studied the sculptures, but discovered that he had fallen in love, which exalted his soul whenever he thought of it. So he gave them away.

Then his great house was empty, and his friends visited Tao again. And they said, "we have traveled far and have great weariness. Do you have room in which to shelter us?" And Tao smiled.
