Masque
======

Stories set in a "realistic" superhero universe.

This is not "realistic" in the sense of "dark, grim, and gritty", the way
DC Comics and certain Marvel properties have trended. This is "realistic"
in the sense of "the world continuing to work however closely you examine
it."

There is a single power origin. There is no conclusive proof of God or
an afterlife, no alien empires being held off from an invasion by half
a dozen brave heroes, no villainous telepaths who can defeat the heroes
but can't be bothered to steal nuclear launch codes.

Oh, there are certainly *hints* of these things - enough to make people
wonder, or worry. There are self-identified angels and self-professed
demons. There are people who work wonders with high technology and
strange creatures whose powers seemingly defy the laws of physics.
Aliens might be coming, or might be here now, or might have been here
once. But there is more than enough wonder and amazement at the
things that human beings themselves can do.

Some of these same setting elements appeared in my post-a-day blog,
[Villains Victorious!](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/), 
and are being played out in my online game,
[Super Sheriffs of Sagan City](https://www.tavern-keeper.com/campaign/764/latest).
