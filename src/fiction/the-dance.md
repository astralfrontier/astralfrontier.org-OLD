You're not Force-sensitive. I am.
You may never understand.
But I'll try to explain anyway.

### "There is no emotion, there is peace"

The most important thing I learned from the Jedi was detachment.

When I was very young, the Jedi came for me.
They cared for me when nobody else did, and in ways nobody else could.

But when I started to show fondness for my teachers, they would move on.
I would be assigned somebody new.
It hurt. I asked why it had to be that way.

"Jedi should not form attachments," I was told.

"What do you mean?" I was confused.
I thought attachments were good.
They felt good. I liked being loved and accepted.

"To teach you is to hurt you. Please forgive us in advance," they said.
I didn't understand.

A week later, I was told that Master Storn Ko,
my first and best lightsaber instructor, had been brutally killed
while chasing down a pack of bounty hunters.

I cried. I raged. I wept. I swore vengeance against his killers,
people I didn't know at all and probably couldn't find.

Master Storn Ko entered my quarters to find me punching the walls.
I broke down. I felt betrayed, angry, but mostly confused.
He was alive. I'd been lied to. But why?

He sat me down, and spoke quietly.
"Everything you see, everyone you know,
leaves a ghost of themselves in your mind.
That ghost becomes your possession.
I am a teacher, but my ghost becomes _your_ teacher. Your property."

"The ghost of me will say things I won't say.
It will do things I won't do.
It becomes your toy.
You project your feelings onto it."

"When you do that, you lose sight of the reality.
And when the real person and the ghost no longer agree,
you hold onto the ghost because you like it more."

"If you cling to the illusion you've made for yourself,
and reject the reality, you reject the Force."

### "There is no ignorance, there is knowledge"

The Jedi Temple trained me in the arts of diplomacy, politics, and war.
I learned to influence minds and peer into hearts.



### "There is no passion, there is serenity"



### "There is no chaos, there is harmony"

### "There is no death, there is the Force."
