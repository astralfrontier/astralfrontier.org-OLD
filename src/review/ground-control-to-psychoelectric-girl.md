### Conclusion

I think the central message of the show is that
some questions can't be answered,
some problems can't be fixed,
and some wishes can't come true.
In the end, we wrap ourselves up in illusions to keep safe from
a confusing, painful world.
It takes effort and courage to admit you're wrong,
and to reach out and really try to understand someone else.

The series uses "alien" mostly as a metaphor for "alienation".
The mysteries of death, the possibility of the unknown,
the strangeness of contact with someone wholly unlike you.
If you look past the initial and superficial harem trappings,
it's an entertaining look at some fractured but functional relationships.
