"Time of Eve" is a six-episode anime. Each episode is only 15 minutes long,
including credits. Despite that, it manages to have a strong impact.

The time is the near future. The place is "probably Japan".
Humanoid androids, apparently emotionless, are distinguishable from humans
by a holographic ring over their heads.
They serve as housekeepers, teachers, and workers.
They obey Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, and the consequences
(practical and emotional) of these laws are central to
most of the stories.

Rikuo, a schoolboy, and his friend Masaki happen across the "Time of Eve",
an underground cafe, which has one rule:
"Within this establishment,
there shall be no distinction between humans and robots".
If Asimov's Three Laws govern robot behavior, this law strongly
shapes and influences the human visitors' behavior.
"Who here is a robot and who here is human?" the two boys wonder,
and try to discover the answer without outright breaking the law of the cafe.
And as the series progresses, Rikuo - and perhaps Masaki - learn
to ask another important question:
"Does it matter?"

Rikuo himself has a family android, called "Sammy", whose growing
humanity fascinates him. Masaki's relationship to the robots is more
complicated, because of the people who helped raise him
(both flesh and metal). The regulars of the cafe all have
their own secrets, sometimes keeping them even from each other,
sometimes sharing them or having them exposed.

The series has a lot of heart for six stories told in a 90-minute
time span. The characters have recognizable and believable
motivations. The secrets they keep are logical, and their reactions
to revelation are heartbreaking or heartwarming or both.

"Time of Eve" would make a wonderful companion piece to darker fare
like "Ex Machina", and like the titular cafe, sits comfortably in
the shadows and spaces left by larger, more violent or dystopian
works. It's light without being inconsequential, with a simple
premise that could drive a full-length series.
