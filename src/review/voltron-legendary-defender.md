"Voltron: Legendary Defender" is a Netflix exclusive.
It is an eleven-episode animated series, combining traditional and CGI
animation done by Dreamworks.

The show was created by the same people responsible for
[Avatar: the Last Airbender](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender),
and it shows in the combination of action and goofy physical and verbal comedy
that distinguished Avatar.

Space pilot cadets Lance, Hunk, and Pidge are investigating the mysteries
of alien contact in Earth's solar system. Along the way they encounter
Keith, Lance's piloting rival before he burned out, on a rescue mission.
A mission on Pluto disappeared, and one of the mission members, named Shiro,
mysteriously reappears with a cybernetic arm and a case of amnesia.

Together the young space explorers discover a secret.
A robotic lion lies buried nearby, and reactivates itself for Lance.
Taken by it into space, they meet Princess Allura and her assistant Coran,
trapped for 10,000 years in stasis pods and wakened by the arrival of
the robot lion and the five Earthlings.

There are a total of five robot lions, which must be found to defeat
the alien Galra empire and its leader, Zarkon, who has been responsible for
the disappearance of the Pluto mission and Shiro's captivity.
The Galra have a stranglehold on all space.
Only Voltron, a giant robot formed by the combination of the five lions,
is said to have the power to stop the Galra and their ambition.

Along the way, the new "paladins" - pilots of the lions - must learn to
work together as a team, overcoming rivalries and mutual suspicion.
They see with their own eyes the horrors the Galra are inflicting,
and dedicate themselves to stopping the Galra by forming Voltron.
