Ravenfall
---------

Kellid warriors fight against the orcs of Belkzen, and have been fighting against them for as long as living men remember. Of the many gods revered by the harsh barbarian tribes, Gorum holds a special place. On the one hand, he is a god of battle and watches over warriors - and any warrior worth his salt will take any advantage he can find. On the other hand, the orcs revere him for similar reasons. To some of the less devout humans, Gorum is less a god, more a trophy to be won.

The fortress of Ravenfall was founded a hundred and fifty years ago. It is a half day's ride from Tolguth, and like that settlement is surrounded by dinosaurs, demons, and danger at every turn. The inhabitants see these things as opportunities, for Ravenfall is the training ground for new priests of Gorum.

Towering dark-haired Kellid warriors draped in barbaric finery, decorated with fetishes and totemic trinkets of every description, are a universal sight at Ravenfall. Thus, the robed and masked visitor to the stone keep, short and burly, was unusual. Under his traveler's cloak, he wore little but the rags and bones and feathers of a tribal shaman, and under his mask was the green tusked face of a half-orc. Slung over his back was a battered and blunted greatsword. For such a one to visit this keep was unheard of, and the guards called for the master of the hall.

The man who answered this call was tall even for one of his people, muscular and fiercely bearded. Hundreds of orcs had fallen before his blade in his days as a battle-priest. Now past his prime, he trained a new generation with iron determination. And his name was Mutun of Ravenfall.

The keep's tradition required that a supplicant to the Lord in Iron bring a ruined greatsword to the lord, as a symbol of the supplicant himself - a potential weapon, but one in need of attention and reforging. Without a word, the stranger unslung his battered blade and presented it ritually.

"I don't train your kind, orc. I train the men who fight you," said Mutun. He bared his broad chest, showing the brand of Gorum upon it. "For eight generations, my family has been pledged to the Lord in Iron."

The half-orc answered by tearing open his traveling rags, revealing an identical brand. Around it was the savage spiraling labyrinth of tattoo work that passed for orcish artistry. "Nine, father," the creature said quietly.

Without a word, Mutun gestured at the guards and beckoned his guest enter Ravenfall.

Belkzen
-------

Before the hearth, out of earshot of the other aspirants still in training, the young half-orc told Mutun his story.

"When you were younger, you raided an orc tribe. The Knak-arak. Some orcs think halfbreeds like me are useful, but not the Knak. Their priests say any orcish woman defiled by a human will bear weaklings and cowards, so they drive them out. You found every woman in the village. Every orc girl. Even a few boys for good measure."

"The tribe couldn't drive all of its women out. So they decided to go into battle with other tribes. A little glory on the way to suicide. My mother was taken as a prize. She survived the fighting long enough to give birth to me, then killed herself. The tribe that took me in, the Icefangs, gave me over to their shaman when they saw this." He tappped his chest.

"The shaman, Bloodtongue, saw the mark. He'd seen it before. He knew who you were, who your family was. He raised me to worship Gorum. He taught me how to keep the tribe's warriors strong enough to fight. And then he gave me to them. 'Gorum demands war,' he said. 'He will teach you through them.'"

"We fought orcs. Other orc tribes. Years would go by when I wouldn't see a human. Finally they told me to go to my father for a warrior's name. They only knew me as the son of another tribe's woman. They didn't know I wasn't a full orc. Bloodtongue never told them. He just called me 'boy'. So... I left the tribe."

Mutun listened to all this. He took a long drink of beer. And he spoke just two sentences.

"Finish your training here. Do that, and I'll give you what you came for."

In time, the young half-orc had proven himself to the men and women of Ravenfall. He endured the abuse, the "training accidents", the hostility. And he presented himself before Mutun. The older man withdrew a reforged greatsword, sharp and ready for blood, and ritually offered it.

"Have you anything to say, priest of Gorum?" asked Mutun.

As the blade passed into the young half-orc's hands, he bowed his head. "This fighting between orcs and humans cannot be won by either side. War without hope of victory is nothing but slaughter. There are wars worth fighting. This isn't one of them. I'll have no more of it."

Mutun nodded. "Then your place is not here. Go find yourself a worthy battle, Karn of Ravenfall."

Tymon
-----

Karn had come to Tymon, 750 miles from Ravenfall, in search of a legend. The half-orc champion Ullorth Ungin had risen to rulership here, governing a city-state perpetually on the edge of war with neighboring Razmiran. If another hybrid being could achieve prominence, the cleric reasoned, there was opportunity for him as well. He was still young and inexperienced, only a novice priest of Gorum and only a fair hand at the blade, but he was full of hope for his future here.

What he saw in the fortified city-state disheartened him. The arenas weren't the training grounds for the strong; they were all betting and bloodshed. The River Freedoms had the appealing ring of liberty to his youthful ears, but his eyes were open enough to see the abuses to which they were put. True, many half-orcs lived here. True, many fellow priests of Gorum could be found here. But he felt no kinship to his race or others of his faith. He didn't feel the call of bloodlust so prevalent the unstable River Kingdoms. The orcs had never raised him gently, but Bloodtongue had shown him that the sacred could be found in everything. Wherever death was close, so was the divine. But not here. It was time to leave.

The polar trade route relies on the Sellen River, terminating at the trade city of Cassomir. While most goods are in practice resold in the ports of Absalom, that city's peculiar laws make it profitable for traders to collude on the continent, then resell to a single merchant prince on the island. A mercantile expedition offered him the opportunity to escape.

He signed on as an armed escort, trading vigilance and skill at arms for three hot meals a day and a berth on the river barge. As with Ravenfall, he concealed both his youth and his half-orc features behind a thick traveler's cloak and a cloth mask. His competence and reliability were better than the typical bravo or thug one might scrape off the riverbank for such duty, but they weren't tested; the journey was a quiet one.

Absalom
-------

Karn's tour of duty ended at Cassomir. There it was that he heard the first true stories of Absalom, the City at the Center of the World. Rumors of extraplanar visitors, of men ascended to godhood, of fortunes to be made and warlords looking for likely men at arms, of the Flotsam Graveyard and the First Guard. He'd heard hints before, but they sounded so incredible that he'd discounted them as myth or fairy tale. But so close to the truth, he was forced to reconsider.

And so he booked passage across the sea. When the boat had docked and he had taken stock of his prospects, he made his way to the Foreign Quarter and sought out the most familiar thing he could find - the Irorium.
