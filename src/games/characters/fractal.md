title: Fractal
synopsis: An unusual combination of power choice and team role.
---

"They say that the moment the chief turned away to look at something, he was gone.
Stealthy as anything - no noise of a window opening, no sound of footsteps."

"The thief was running away from him, turned into a blind alley - and there he was!
Somehow he got there faster, knew where the guy was going to run to. It was amazing."

"Sinferno must have broken half the ribs in his body, even with that armor. But the next
day he didn't show a sign of pain. He's just unstoppable."

"He knows a dozen martial arts styles and probably has a dozen PhDs. I've heard him
answer questions from every major branch of science, then turn around and do a professional
forensic analysis that left the local cops baffled."

The superhero who calls himself "Fractal" seems, at first glance, to be a costumed vigilante,
the product of intense training and widespread study. Fractal's true power is a closely guarded
secret. His ability is the duplication of his body into multiple copies, up to dozens
at a time. He has a variety of secret identities, from unassuming college students studying
a variety of subjects, to beat cops, criminals, detectives, and scientists. He is a student,
adventurer, athlete, and more in his various incarnations. His mind is spread across the
duplicates, allowing him to instantly know what any of his selves are aware of.

Psychovore
==========

Fractal's worst enemy is a lunatic telepath called Psychovore. Once he has a genetic link with
a target - through blood, flesh, or even inheritance - he can read and influence the target's mind,
steal their memories or personality, and more. As long as the genetic material remains fresh,
he can make use of the memories, skills, and minds he consumes. Fractal, however, creates duplicates
out of a psychokinetic substance called ectoplasm - enough to convincingly simulate a human
body, but not enough for the villain's powers to connect with.

Psychovore knows Fractal's secret, but doesn't know where he keeps his real body - the one
that would allow Psychovore's powers to work on him. Psychovore's obsession is to acquire the
multiple lifetimes of expertise Fractal possesses. He believes the hero can manage to do what
Psychovore himself cannot - integrate all his stolen minds into a single super-brilliant whole
and turn the world into a jigsaw reflection of his own twisted psyche. To achieve this,
he refuses to share the hero's secret with anyone else - after all, if they kill him for real,
Psychovore will lose his chance.

Psychovore's body has a healing factor, common to most super-beings. The villain has surgically
grafted many stolen body parts - fingers, patches of skin, and the like - from those of high-value
targets of his telepathy, letting him perpetually tap into their talents. His own mind is a bizarre
farrago of thoughts, images, plans, and motives, and his body is a horrifying jigsaw of skin tones
and stolen body parts.
