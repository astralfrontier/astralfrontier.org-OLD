**Background:**

Paco Ramon was big news in Detroit after joining the JLA. He inspired people he never met. And he fathered a child he never knew.

Gabriel Ramon is the son of a Brazilian immigrant mother who Paco had briefly met. He knew who his father was, as did his mother Sofia. And when he grew older, he found that he'd inherited Vibe's sound powers as well. His mother told him one thing: "don't end up like your father".

Gabe was intelligent and ambitious, and he put these things to use. His powers let him create uniquely entertaining shows at night, and his mind kept him focused on his studies during the day. When he graduated as a straight-A student, he had enough money saved up to get into a good college.

He never forgot his roots, though, and life in his neighborhood was hard. He solved that problem with his brains, too. He set out to find the best teacher and role model he could for growing up tough, and settled on Bruce Lee. Like the legendary martial artist, he studied everything from ballet to boxing to breakdancing to Kung Fu, learning and honing a fighting style that would protect him from the rougher parts of Detroit life. He settled on a fusion of his idol's style - Jeet Kune Do - and the Brazilian art of Capoeira, which meshed well with his interest in dance.

Gabe is looking for a direction in life. He could become many things - a teacher, a professional dancer, a scientist - but more and more he thinks about Paco Ramon. The streets of his home city were dangerous, but the memory of Vibe inspired the people living there to become better. Maybe they need another hero to become as great as they could be. Gabe reluctantly realizes that he could be it - as long as he doesn't end up like his father.

Notes on fighting style: Gabe uses his sonic powers to propel his Capoeira and boxing moves at high speed, or when he connects with a punch or kick. He can create music or distracting noises, or simply overwhelm an enemy with a wall of sonic energy.
