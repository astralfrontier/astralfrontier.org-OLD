title: Bootstrapping your crafting in FFXIV patch 3.3
---

I had to piece together the following steps, so I wanted to share them
with everybody in a simple, straightforward fashion.

The goal is to get a novice crafter (Disciples of Hand/Land levels 50-60)
set up for success at endgame (3 or 4 star recipe) crafting.

### Getting to 60

You should have all your Disciple of Hand classes at 50.
If you do not, I highly recommend the 1-50 guides available
at [FFXIV Guild](http://www.ffxivguild.com/).

Aside from the leveling guides from FFXIV Guild, the recent
patch introduced Moogles as a beast tribe quest giver.
You can unlock their daily quests using the steps outlined
[here](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/678050-final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/73831854).

I strongly encourage you to keep your Mining and Botany up to date as well.
If not, you will be buying a lot of materials you could farm for yourself.

### Specialization

You can use the [Specialist System](http://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Specialist_System)
to specialize in up to three crafting classes.
These work very similar to combat jobs:
you get an equippable soul, along with specific abilities.
Having the soul equipped also gives you +20 to both Craftsmanship and Control.

What should you specialize in?
Blacksmith, Leatherworking, and Weaving produce the eventual
tools and equipment, but they depend on materials produced by Alchemy
and other crafts.

### First Tier: Chimerical Felt and Serpentskin

You should end your level 60 quests with some or all of the following pieces.
Buy or make HQ versions of the remainder if possible.

* [Chimerical Felt Turban of Crafting](http://xivdb.com/item/11959/Chimerical+Felt+Turban+of+Crafting)
* [Chimerical Felt Doublet of Crafting](http://xivdb.com/item/11964/Chimerical+Felt+Doublet+of+Crafting)
* [Dragonskin Belt of Crafting](http://xivdb.com/item/11971/Dragonskin+Belt+of+Crafting)
* [Chimerical Felt Skirt](http://xivdb.com/item/11977/Chimerical+Felt+Skirt)
* [Serpentskin Halfgloves of Crafting](http://xivdb.com/item/11969/Serpentskin+Halfgloves+of+Crafting)
* [Serpentskin Shoes](http://xivdb.com/item/11982/Serpentskin+Shoes)
* [Hallowed Chestnut Necklace](http://xivdb.com/item/12012/Hallowed+Chestnut+Necklace)
* [Dragon Fang Earrings](http://xivdb.com/item/12018/Dragon+Fang+Earrings)
* [Hallowed Chestnut Armillae](http://xivdb.com/item/12015/Hallowed+Chestnut+Armillae)
* [Hallowed Chestnut Ring](http://xivdb.com/item/12021/Hallowed+Chestnut+Ring)

Item level 140 main and off hand tools are available as quest rewards
or crafted items.

### Second Tier: Blue Scrip Gear

If you haven't already, you should be building up a stock of Blue and Red Scrip.
This is obtained by crafting collectible items, or gathering collectible raw
materials.

To obtain scrip, look at the Timer (control-U), then click on
Rowena's House of Splendors.
This will tell you the items you can deliver for the day to receive scrip.
Each collectible must be manufactured, or gathered, as a collectible,
and must meet a minimum collectibility value.

Your goal for Blue Scrip is to buy the item level 180 crafting gear
from the Splendors Vendor (5, 7) in Idyllshire.
Your goal for Red Scrip is to buy Goblin Cups from the Scrip Exchange
vendor next door.
Each Cup costs 50 Red Scrip, and there's a weekly cap of 450, so
you can get at most 9 cups a week.

Once you have enough Goblin Cups, and a supply of the crafting gear
of your choice, you can trade the crafting items and cups to
Grinmox (6, 7) also in Idyllshire. It costs 27 cups to upgrade a
complete set to its Augmented form, but you don't have to, and you don't want to.

Don't get the Red Scrip offhands! This is a waste of valuable scrip.

Your goal is to reach the minimum requirements to make Ironworks
gear, the next tier: 870 Craftsmanship, 835 Control.

Be sure to include Food and Specialization bonuses (+20 Cra/Con)
in these numbers.
HQ Beet Soup gives you the best overall bonus to both of these stats.

### Gathering Books

If you are farming your own materials rather than buying them on the
Marketplace, you will want to buy the six Folklore books from the
Idyllshire Splendors Vendor (5, 7).
Each book costs 99 Blue Gatherer's Scrip,
and there are six books between Botany and Mining.

Currently the best Blue Gatherer's Scrip comes from a mixture of
Red Quartz and Cuprite.
Doing this rotation every 30 minutes or so will give you one book
every six hours.

### Third Tier: Ironworks gear

Once you are at 870 and 835, you can manufacture the Ironworks set:

* Ironworks Cap, Apron, Sleeves, Belt, Breeches, and Boots.
* Ironworks Earrings and Rings.

I'm not here yet, so details are coming soon.
