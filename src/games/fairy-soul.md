title: Fairy Soul
template: fullpage-title.jade
synopsis: A Victorian urban fantasy.
---

As of 1880 A.D., the few scholars who acknowledge the truth of fairies know a great and terrible secret: almost all the fairies are asleep, locked in prisons crafted from the human soul. Every man, woman, and child alive has a sleeping fairy soul inside them, kept quiescent by bending human magic power inward.

Only humans contain the primordial inner power of magic, but only fairies are capable of shaping and wielding such power. Perhaps the two races fought, due to jealousy, fear, or some specific *casus belli*. Perhaps it's an amicable arrangement, and everyone alive has simply forgotten the reasons for it. Perhaps it's something else entirely, something only the sleeping immortal souls could reveal.

But there is a new war. Chimeric monsters, dark dabblers in the occult, and enigmatic creatures stalk the streets of London. Other wonders - and unspeakable dangers - have been reported throughout the Empire. Those who would fight back against them have a power, but not always their own. Is it right to use this captive soul for your own ends? And if you could find a way to free the fairy race, would that be better for the world.. or worse?

Stats
-----

Characters have five stats, aligning with the classical elements. These represent not only their own physical and mental prowess, but their connection to their Fairy Soul (for those that have one).

* *Air* - the inquisitive or exploratory principle.
* *Earth* - the persuasive or assertive principle.
* *Fire* - the aggressive or forceful principle.
* *Water* - the reflexive or graceful principle.
* *Aether* - the mystical or occult principle.

Relationships
-------------

PCs have a "Relationship" stat. At the end of each session, each player can adjust their relationship with one PC up or down by 1.

Characters whose Fairy Soul is at all awake have a Relationship with it. The MC determines adjustments to this value.

Playbooks
---------

* The *Hero*, whose Fairy Soul has been removed from them somehow. Their raw magical power flows forth unimpeded, allowing them to perform amazing feats and great deeds. But the loss of that soul means the loss of their dreams, and they are forever seeking and yearning for something to fill that void.
* The *Galvanist*, whose Fairy Soul manifests as energetic power in the physical realm. By tapping into their sleeping other half, they work wonders with both the classical elements and the "new elements of science" - electricity and chemistry. Their control over another's magic makes their power unreliable or difficult to control.
* The *Mesmerist*, whose Fairy Soul whispers to the minds and hearts of others. Through illusion, animal magnetism, and the mastery of invisible forces, they can heal, create cunning phantasms or bewitchments, or even enter dreams. The inhuman whispers of a fairy, though, do not always produce the effects they desire.
* The *Zoanthrope*, whose Fairy Soul is drawn partially into the physical world, changing a person's own body. Zoanthropes can become animals, monsters, or weird hybrid creatures. They are powerful combatants and cunning hunters, provided their new instincts do not overwhelm their human reason.
* The *Evoker*, whose Fairy Soul can be brought into the world as a thing separate from the human summoning it. Evokers are closest to their fairies, many of whom are briefly conscious and act more like partners than tools. At the same time, an Evoker's partner can be willful or independent.
