## What you need to play

* Two or more players.
* A set of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12). Only one set is needed, but it's easier if every player has their own.

## Creating a character

Each player comes up with a *character*.
Write a concept, such as "seemingly meek priest" or "unappreciated lady knight".
Based on that concept, you will pick *traits*, calculate *heart armor*, and start a *quest*.

### Traits

You have **traits**, divided into *identity*, *experiences*, *ideals*, and *sacrifices*.

Your **identity** is who you are, or see yourself to be.
"Knight", "Scholar", or "Aristocrat" are all examples of an identity.

Your **experiences** describe what you've seen and done, and the lessons life has taught you.
"War veteran" or "Wilderness survivor" are experiences.

Your **ideals** are the hopes and dreams you fight for, the virtues you uphold, and the morals you obey.
"Hope", "Justice", and "Peace" can all be ideals.

Your **sacrifices** are things you've given up, had taken away, or otherwise lost.
Though a sacrifice can mean pain or despair, overcoming (or at least living with it) requires a certain strength.
"True love", "Family", or "High position" could all be sacrifices.

You start a new game with three traits, chosen from any of the four types of traits.
For example, you might begin with an identity, and ideal, and a sacrifice, or two experiences and one ideal.
You can gain or change traits during play, by progressing on your *quest*.

You can look into the Historium for traits to select, or work out new ones with the rest of the group.

Each trait includes one or more *Gambits*, which improve and specialize your ability to influence a crisis.
For example, a soldier would be better at managing situations of fear
than someone who identifies as a merchant or a romantic.

Your traits are either *revealed* or *hidden*.
All your traits start as hidden at the beginning of every crisis, and are revealed during play.
Revealing a trait is required to unlock access to any Gambits the trait provides.

### Heart armor

You have a score called **heart armor**.
Heart armor reflects how emotionally invested you are in the situation, and also how emotionally vulnerable.
Too little empathy leaves you unable to meaningfully fix the crisis at hand,
while too much blinds you to what's right - or what's coldly necessary.

You start each crisis with a heart armor of 1, plus 1 for every trait you possess.
Heart armor drops by 1 every time you reveal a trait.
Other things can raise or lower your heart armor, even if a trait isn't revealed.

If something drops your heart armor to 0, you are no longer able to meaningfully affect the current crisis.
Maybe you became too close to the problem, or lost the trust of those around you, for example.

### Quests

Your **quest** is a personal mission, driving ambition, or recurring situation.
Recovering a kidnapped prince, finding a family heirloom, or avenging yourself on a treacherous cousin could all be quests.

TODO: more detail - this is the advancement mechanic.

## Playing the game

The game is set around a series of *crises*, connected like acts in a play that will ideally form a coherent story.

A *crisis* is any bad situation fraught with emotion and involving multiple people,
which must be resolved by the characters' actions.
A crisis should be easily understandable by itself,
should ideally connect with the larger story being told,
and should take no more than a single typical game session to resolve.

A **fate** is a description of something that will conclusively end the crisis - for good or ill.
Every fate should ideally set up one or more other crises for the characters to pursue,
even if it's "whatever is in the next town".
Almost every fate is associated with either the presence or absence of a particular emotion.
For example, a fate in which a mob of angry villagers storms the villain's castle could be tied to anger,
while a fate about acceptance and forgiveness could be tied to joy.

Every crisis starts with a **dark fate**,
which is the tragic outcome that will result if the characters were not present or did nothing.

Every crisis can have other *fates*, which the characters create or discover.
The goal of the characters during a crisis is to open up new fates that represent desirable outcomes,
and to steer the dominant emotions of the situation towards those which allow that fate to be realized.

Every fate has an **Omen** score, indicating how strongly events have pushed it towards inevitability.

Every crisis has a **Tension** score, which is the sum of Omen for all fates in play at the moment.

Player characters are powerful and competent people,
but they cannot always control what other people think or feel.
Because of that, there is only one rule for what the players can narrate their characters doing:
they need **fictional license**, which is a plausible reason that's acceptable to the player group as a whole.
Whatever a player narrates, and has license to narrate, is real and happens as described.

If narration would invalidate a fate, it can either be rewritten to reflect the new reality,
or removed from play. If the narration would invalidate the dark fate, the group must devise a new
dark fate. In any case, any fate that emerges from the loss of an old one inherits the Omen score of the old fate.

### The emotional map

![Emotion Cube](/assets/emotion-cube.png)

The **emotional map** is a visual representation of the dominant feelings in a crisis.
There are eight core emotions, and each emotion has a *Power* score starting at 0.
Power reflects the intensity or tenacity of that feeling among the people affected by the crisis.

The emotional map only reflects the feelings of non-player characters.
Nothing in the game can force a player or character to think or feel a certain thing.
Only you can declare what's true in your heart.

If a rule refers to a given feeling's **neighbors**, this is all feelings exactly one
step away from that feeling. For example, Joy's neighbors are Contempt, Fear, and Anticipation.

### Establishing a crisis

The players as a group should talk about the crisis - what the problem is,
who's involved, and what's at stake.
This includes providing a dark fate for the situation.

At the start of each crisis,
every PC marks all their traits as hidden,
and sets their current heart armor to their starting heart armor.

The dark fate receives 1 Omen, as the first and most likely outcome.

Any or all emotions that contribute to the problem should receive Power.
Either pick a Power from 1 to 10, or roll 1d10, for each emotion.

### Handling the crisis

Each player then narrates their character's actions.
There is no set order or turn sequence.
You can narrate anything at any time.

When you narrate, be alert for Gambits whose conditions match what you are describing.

You cannot execute a Gambit without narrating what causes it to be applicable.

### Rolling dice

Some rules will instruct you to roll dice.
They will provide you with two numbers: a *difficulty* and an *ability*.
While rolling, you have two goals:
*buy off the difficulty* by rolling dice, which leaves behind *risk*,
and *buy off the risk* with your ability and optional *complications*.

The steps are as follows:

1. Start paying off the difficulty by rolling dice. You start with a d4, then add a d6, then a d8, then a d10, and finally a d12. Each time, subtract the value on the die from the difficulty.
 * Don’t stop subtracting at zero if the die value takes you into negatives.
 * You must roll the dice in the order given.
 * You can stop rolling at any time.
 * You cannot continue to roll once you've reached your last die.
 * You cannot unroll a die once it’s been rolled.
2. If you're left with a negative number after paying off difficulty, this is your remaining risk. If you tied exactly, you succeeded without complication. If there is still difficulty left after you are done rolling, your action fails.
3. Pay off any remaining risk. First by adding your ability score, and then by adding complications. Once you are no longer in negatives (meaning you have paid off all risk), you succeed.
4. Resolve the effects of any complications you used to buy off risk.

## Gambits

*Gambits* are the way that your player character affects the emotional map.
Every character has access to *common Gambits*,
along with specific Gambits provided by their revealed traits.
The group can create *situational Gambits* in play, based on the current crisis.

Gambits have *conditions* under which they apply.
If a player narrates something that matches a Gambit's condition, the player must then execute that Gambit.
If multiple Gambits seem applicable, the player must execute the most specific one.
If there is disagreement as to which that would be, the player may choose.

Gambits have *costs* which must be satisfied for the Gambit to be executed successfully.
The Gambit's cost can be a call for the player to roll dice, such as "Roll Bond vs. 15".
In this case, the cost is describing an ability to use ("Bond") and a difficulty number ("15").
Some Gambits specify additional costs, which can raise the difficulty of the roll.

Gambits have *consequences*.
These are the mechanical effects of the Gambit, and happen immediately if the Gambit is executed successfully.
The player, or anyone else at the table who has permission, can narrate the consequences in any way they see fit.

Many Gambits allow the player to expand on the consequence, usually by taking on additional cost.
This will be noted in the Gambit's cost.

Many Gambits have *complications*, which allow the player to buy off risk when making die rolls.
These complications are selected by the player.
You can select multiple complications.
The player, or someone else with permission, may narrate the specifics of how the complication comes into play.
If the player cannot apply complications and risk remains, the roll fails.

### Common Gambits

**Deepen Bond**

Characters can form a special connection with a single non-player character per crisis.
This character might be a friend, enemy, ally, or victim,
but it is a viewpoint character through which the player can grapple with the crisis in a personal way.
Characters can make emotional connections with as many or as few NPCs as they like through player narration,
but they will have only one Bond that has a mechanical benefit.

* *Conditions*: When you form an emotional relationship - positive, negative, or mixed - with a non-player character, and end up working with, against, or through them to affect the crisis.
* *Consequences*: Gain 1 Bond with the NPC, or +1 to Bond if you already have a Bond with that NPC. Lose any Bond you have with any other NPC.
* *Costs*: Reveal a trait (which forms the basis of the bond), and roll 1 vs. Tension.
  * Deeper Bond (5 per +1 Bond, optional) - form a stronger bond with the NPC.
* *Complications*:
  * Entanglement (3 per revealed trait) - your encounter with the NPC made you give away something about yourself, or resonated deeply with you emotionally. Reveal one or more extra traits.
  * Doom (5) - connecting with the NPC set events in motion that will worsen the crisis. The crisis's dark fate gains 1 Omen.
  * Mood Swing (3) - your connection to the NPC caused an unexpected feeling to surface. Roll 1d8 and count clockwise from Joy that many times, and increase the resulting emotion's Power by 1.

**Strengthen Feeling**

* *Conditions*: When you do something that would make people feel something more deeply than they do already, or feel something they don't yet.
* *Consequences*: Increase Power of a chosen feeling by 1 or more.
* *Costs*: Roll Bond vs. desired Power of the chosen feeling.
  * Neighbors (total Power of all neighbors) - competing emotions will interfere with the development of a new feeling.
  * Desperate Times (Tension) - as the situation grows more complex, it becomes harder to get people to change.
* *Complications*:
  * Sacrifice (Bond) - you lose your connection with your Bonded NPC.
  * Entanglement (3 per revealed trait) - your attempt made you give away something about yourself, or resonated deeply with you emotionally. Reveal one or more extra traits.
  * Doom (5) - your meddling set events in motion that will worsen the crisis. The crisis's dark fate gains 1 Omen.
  * Deflection (3 per +1 Power) - your efforts trigger another emotion's growth. Roll 1d8 and count clockwise from Joy that many times, and increase the resulting emotion's Power by 1.

 **Weaken Feeling**

* *Conditions*: When you do something that would make people feel something less deeply than they do already, or eliminate a strong feeling.
* *Consequences*: Decrease Power of a chosen feeling by 1 or more.
* *Costs*: Roll Bond vs. current Power of the chosen feeling.
  * Desperate Times (Tension) - as the situation grows more complex, it becomes harder to get people to change.
* *Complications*:
  * Sacrifice (Bond) - you lose your connection with your Bonded NPC.
  * Entanglement (3 per revealed trait) - your attempt made you give away something about yourself, or resonated deeply with you emotionally. Reveal one or more extra traits.
  * Doom (5) - your meddling set events in motion that will worsen the crisis. The crisis's dark fate gains 1 Omen.
  * Deflection (3 per +1 Power) - instead of soothing feelings, you simply move them. Roll 1d8 and count clockwise from Joy that many times, and increase the resulting emotion's Power by 1.

**Shift Feeling**

* *Conditions*: When you do something that would make people feel something different than they do now, but just as strongly
* *Consequences*: Decrease Power of a chosen feeling by 1 or more, and increase a neighbor's Power by the same amount.
* *Costs*: Roll Bond vs. current Power of the chosen feeling.
  * Neighbors (total Power of all neighbors, except the target) - competing emotions will interfere with the development of a new feeling.
  * Desperate Times (Tension) - as the situation grows more complex, it becomes harder to get people to change.
* *Complications*:
  * Sacrifice (Bond) - you lose your connection with your Bonded NPC.
  * Entanglement (3 per revealed trait) - your attempt made you give away something about yourself, or resonated deeply with you emotionally. Reveal one or more extra traits.
  * Doom (5) - your meddling set events in motion that will worsen the crisis. The crisis's dark fate gains 1 Omen.
  * Deflection (3 per +1 Power) - instead of soothing feelings, you simply move them. Roll 1d8 and count clockwise from Joy that many times, and increase the resulting emotion's Power by 1.

**Foreshadowing**

* *Conditions*: When you narrate something suggestive of a specific conclusion to the crisis, attached to a specific emotion.
* *Consequences*: Create a new fate with 1 Omen, or increase Omen by 1.
* *Costs*: Roll Emotion vs. Tension.
* *Complications*:
  * TODO

**Catharsis**

* *Conditions*: When you do something that would resolve the crisis according to a given fate.
* *Consequences*: The fate is realized, and the crisis is over.
* *Costs*: Roll Emotion vs. Tension.
  * Neighbors (total Power of all neighbors) - if there are still opposing feelings in play, they'll interfere with the resolution.
* *Complications*: None. This Gambit must succeed on the strength of the emotion, or not at all.
