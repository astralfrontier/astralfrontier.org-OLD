title: My Beliefs
---

Overall, I believe in a *data-driven life*.
I accept the primacy of reality and the power of evidence.
I believe that the scientific method achieves meaningful, worthwhile results.

If you are reading this web page on a computer,
the power of the scientific method is self-evident,
as those tools are the products of that method.

"Truth" is not a substance or quantity of its own.
Truth is the collection of statements shown to be *true*:
that is, in accord with reality.

### Key Concepts

* *Assertion and demonstration*. You can assert something - saying that it's true - but you can also demonstrate something - presenting evidence that leads your audience inescapably to the same conclusion you asserted. If you assert without demonstrating, I will probably not be convinced.
* *The laws of thought*. I accept the [laws of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_thought). If you don't, we by definition can't have a rational conversation.

### Politics

I label myself as a progressive liberal.

I prefer government that is open, transparent, and interested in promoting the welfare of its citizens.

I think government has a place in the regulation of the economy, but does not replace or dominate the economy.

I favor individual rights to the extent that they don't threaten the community through their exercise.
For example, I support restrictions on alcohol such as DUI laws, and laws controlling the possession and sale of firearms.

I think if you can't study a problem, you can't act effectively against it.
But once you've got the data you need to act, you should act.
For this reason, I accept the broad scientific consensus on global climate change.

### Religion

As yet, I have seen no compelling evidence that demonstrates the existence of any god as a real being.

I am receptive to such evidence if you can present it.
For this purpose, "evidence" means "scientific evidence",
which is "a fact that leads to one and only one conclusion".
For example, "the house is on fire" is a fact, but not evidence
of arson or accident, because either of those sources are possible.
"Traces of a plastic explosive were found at the house fire" is
evidence for arson.

I have seen abundant evidence of contradictions for claims about the Christian God.
If you want to assert Christianity, part of your demonstration should include
resolutions for those contradictions.

If you present me with a [point refuted a thousand times](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/PRATT),
I will point you at the refutation.
If this happens, please either address the refutation (beyond "well that's wrong"),
or try another argument.

If you believe that I have an anti-religious "agenda", you're welcome to that belief.
However, don't make such a claim to my face unless you can:

1. Identify the agenda ("Bill wants to discredit Christianity", "Bill wants to convert people to atheism", etc.)
2. Show me conversations I've had, or posts I've made, that demonstrate me advancing this agenda. You can find links to my social media profiles in the "sharing" icon on the top right of my website. Start there, then send me links.

Since Christianity has a doctrinal obligation to proselytize, I would also ask any Christians if they think this constitutes an "agenda" on their part.
