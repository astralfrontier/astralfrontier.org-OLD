# Rift

[Rift] is a free-to-play MMO, formerly subscription based, and a generally superior clone of World of Warcraft.
I play it from time to time (moreso thanks to the F2P element).

### Distinguishing Features

What separates Rift from WoW and earlier MMOs?

* Ongoing world PVE in the form of rifts, which are planar portals which must be closed by killing the invasion forces. Each rift connects to one of six planes (Air, Earth, Fire, Water, Death, and Life), and there are several distinct types of rifts that each plane will send. Rift-spawned mobs are leveled appropriately to the zone in which the rift opened.
* Raid rifts (for 10+ players) and periodic "invasion" events in a randomly chosen zone, which can involve dozens of players closing rifts, killing invasion mobs, or doing more specialized activities, culminating in a series of bosses.
* Four "Callings" (Warrior, Mage, Cleric, and Rogue), each with access to several "souls" (for example, Mage has Elementalist, Stormcaller, Pyromancer, Necromancer, and other typically wizardly specializations). Each soul is a single talent tree providing access to a series of spells or abilities; players choose a single calling, fixed for life, and mix-and-match 3 souls to fill roles (Tank, DPS, Healer, Support).
