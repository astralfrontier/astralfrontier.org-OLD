# Rift

I played this for awhile. It felt like a much better, more polished version of Warcraft. Unfortunately I stopped due to the social experience (which is to say, nobody from my old guild was interested in moving over).

Pros:

* Fantastic world PVE
* Beautiful terrain
* Fantastic world PVE
* Highly flexible class+talent system, allowing you to mix and match up to three "souls" in a class
* Did I mention fantastic world PVE?
