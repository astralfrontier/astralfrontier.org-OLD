Summary: A suggestion for a new MMO

# Doctor Who Online

Why not a Doctor Who MMO? I don't mean Worlds in Time, I mean a real, honest-to-goodness, 20-bear-asses MMO.

The Time War decimated the Time Lords' population. At some point after the events of the new series, Gallifrey begins training a new batch of Time Lords. They take their cue from the man who saved the universe time and again - the Doctor - and tell this lot to go adventuring.

So you have a bunch of noob Time Lords running around the galaxy in their TARDISes. Right there you have player housing - decorate your TARDIS how you like, internally or externally. Chameleon circuits let the external model copy any conventional object in the game, and/or you can establish interior themes (maybe for real money, who knows).

Planets can be procedurally generated for solo play, or you can visit "fixed points" or "crises" - places where multiple Time Lords team up to defeat a powerful enemy in ways that follow some sort of script. You know, instanced dungeons. The well-known planets of the franchise can be represented easily enough.

If you get tired of playing a Time Lord, roll an alt! You can be a PC companion to your Time Lord "main" - a contemporary or historical human, a Silurian, or anything else.

The designers should take a page from Bioware (as should everyone), but specifically how SWTOR implemented companions. Do the same thing here, get a rich stable of supporting characters together, and write interesting stories with them.

What are the advantages of doing this from a business perspective?

First, Doctor Who is a staple of scifi. You have instant name recognition across almost the entire MMO-playing demographic. It probably won't be as violent, so you might lose the hardcore raiding types.

Second, your creative team has literally decades of source material to draw from. Sets, props, storylines, everything - the new series isn't afraid to revisit the past and neither should you. When you've mined that out, head over to Big Finish. Not only do they have a ton of stories, they've also had people doing voice work for the franchise already and you might be able to convince those guys to come voice your game.

Third, you've got an established precedent. SWTOR went free to play in November 2012 and they are still going strong. They have many of the same qualities a hypothetical Doctor Who MMO would have (name recognition, existing franchise, etc.)

So how about it, Internet?
