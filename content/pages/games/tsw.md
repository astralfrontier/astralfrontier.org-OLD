# The Secret World

**The Secret World** is a horror and conspiracy MMO. It is currently free-to-play.

Story
-----

The general story is that of supernatural beings' assault on Gaia - creatures like the Eastern European strigoi, or vampires, the interdimensional corruption called the Filth, the insectile Ak'ab, cunning gods of ancient pantheons, and more.

The NPCs are consistently well-written, with cut scenes fully voiced (and by actors like Tim Russ and Jeffrey Combs).

Gameplay and Mechanics
----------------------

There are no races or classes, and three mututally competitive factions (the Illuminati, the Templars, and the Dragon). Characters can play various MMO roles (tank, healer, melee or ranged DPS) by equipping the right abilities and items.

Characters have a primary and secondary weapon, and several talismans which fulfill the role of armor or accessories in other games.

Characters have 7 ability slots for Active abilities, and 7 more slots for Passive abilities. Passives are benefits triggered by various conditions ("when you hit a target, you get X", or "when struck, you get Y"). Active abilities are your spells, powers, and so forth. Some have cooldowns, casting times, and so on. Almost all abilities are tied to a specific weapon, and active abilities require that weapon to be equipped.

TSW is built around a builder/consumer model, 4 debuff conditions (Weakened, Hindered, Afflicted, and Impaired), and multiple modifiers to damage (Glancing, Critical, Penetrating). Your two equipped weapons each have a pool of 5 resources - either on you or on your target, depending on the specific type of weapon. For example, a Blade/Assault Rifle combination lets you build up Blade resources on you, and build up Rifle resources on any target you hit. Your rotation consists of casting resource-building attacks, then using consumer attacks as followup or finisher moves. A typical resource builder builds for all equipped weapons, and a typical consumer consumes only its associated weapon's resources - thus, you'll use a builder 5 times, and then 2 different consumers.
