Summary: Common tropes encountered in WoW raiding
Categories: games

# Raid Tropes

Raiding in World of Warcraft (and presumably other MMOs) has produced a collection of commonly-accepted gambits used by both NPC mobs and raiders themselves. Since most raid encounters in the game consist of combinations or variations on these tactics or situations, I'm cataloging them under the collective header of raid tropes, inspired from the tvtropes.org site.

### Add-Powered Bubble

The boss has some sort of impenetrable shield, or flies around the battlefield untouchable by mortal heroes, or simply regenerates so fast that there's no hope of killing it... unless you kill its helpers first. Such a boss has an Add-Powered Bubble. Either way, the adds generally stop coming once you've accomplished this.

Sometimes the bubble is penetrable, and you must devote some of your attention to add management while still keeping some people focused on opening up the boss to attack. If it isn't, and your only hope of Phase Transition is to kill some quantity of adds, you're in a Trash Gauntlet.

#### Examples

Sunwell Plateau

* M'uru becomes Entropius, the "true" boss, when his HP is depleted. Until that time, he has adds which continually spawn.

Ulduar

* Razorscale is periodically DPSed while in her air phase via the harpoons. Until 50% HP, though, the raid must kill her adds to enable themselves to use the harpoons.
* Freya's Attuned to Nature stacks are depleted by killing her spawns.

Icecrown Citadel

* Lady Deathwhisper surrounds herself with a mana shield and spawns adds (and spams Shadowbolts...) during her first phase.

### Boss With Adds

An encounter sometimes features a boss who has helpers or support, either summoned during the fight or present at the start.

If these mobs merit the title (and HP pool) of "boss" in their own right, they are Minibosses. If fighting the adds is a prerequisite to a successful Phase Transition and the boss is relatively invulnerable during that time, then it has an Add-Powered Bubble. Some bosses aren't reachable until you work through a Trash Gauntlet.

#### Examples

Throne of the Four Winds

* Anshal in the Conclave of Wind encounter will summon five adds which must be burned down before the ultimate attack begins.

### Charge Spam

The boss picks a random party member and charges them, knocking them down, stunning them, or otherwise doing something unpleasant. Often part of a Spinning Top's repertoire of attacks. Sometimes this will only happen if you are beyond a certain range, necessitating a Group Hug.

#### Examples

Karazhan

* Attumen the Huntsman

Ulduar

* This tendency is what makes Auriaya so deadly to an unprepared raid.

Icecrown Citadel

* Lord Marrowgar charges four people in sequence during phase 2.

### Chariots of Fire

When You Are the Bomb, sometimes you need to run away, or you'll start dropping Void Zones on the ground. The result is that you must continually run away from the spots which are spawning; thus, Chariots of Fire.

### Conjoined Twins

The "boss" actually comes in the form of multiple mobs which share an HP pool, resurrect if only one of them is killed, or something similar. In practice, the DPS usually splits up somehow to handle these encounters. If the bosses are tackled in sequence, or are otherwise relatively unique entities, you are probably in a Multiboss encounter.

#### Examples

Bastion of Twilight

* Valiona and Theralion share a health pool. While one dragon is on the ground, the other will fly around causing trouble.

### Don't Stand Next to Other People

In some encounters, everyone is the bomb - that, or mitigating AOE damage is just too vital. The raid must position itself such that no member is within X yards of each other, or the boss, or whatever.

This is the opposite of Group Hug.

#### Examples

Bastion of Twilight

* Avoiding Theralion's Twilight Bursts during Valiona's ground phase requires that people stay spread out.

### Don't Stand in the Fire

Some bosses just love dropping Void Zone after Void Zone on the ground. This can be fire, acid, inky black spots, naked blood elf girls, or anything else likely to cause you harm. But no matter its outward form, it's still fire.

If the fire is a wall rather than a spot on the ground, this may end up splitting the raid or moving people out of range of the healers, so Position Matters.

If the fire moves, it's Eyebeams Pew Pew.

#### Examples

Baradin Hold

* Argaloth rains down fire across the entire map at 66% and 33% health, leading to Keystone Kops-style running around.

Bastion of Twilight

* Theralion's ground phase includes void zones which the ranged pack must avoid, and Dazzling Destruction will ship you to the twilight realm if you stand in it during a phase transition.

### Doomsday Clock

A Doomsday Clock is a timer of some sort that will trigger a permanent Enrage or other presumably fatal outcome once it expires. The usual intent is to force the raid into completing the encounter in a timely fashion.

If the boss has no other particular gimmicks but does have a relatively aggressive Doomsday Clock, it is probably a Gear Check. Doomsday Clocks can be more serious during Hard Mode.

#### Examples

Naxxramas

* Patchwerk is a straightforward example of a boss who will wipe the raid once his timer runs out.

### Enrage

An Enrage or frenzy is any sort of sudden increase in a boss's damage or other capabilities. Almost all raid bosses have a Doomsday Clock which enrages them when it runs out, but many will have shorter, weaker forms which either go away or can be removed by the raid.

Many enrages of this sort are accompanied by heavy raid damage.

In some encounters, tanks can Stand in the Good Stuff to survive the assault, or they may kite the boss.

This is usually more sudden than a Stacking Debuff, and usually requires some mitigation aside from a simple Tank Swap.

#### Examples

Molten Core

* Magmadar's enrage was dispellable by a hunter (specifically), who learned the ability to do so from a drop off the previous boss.
    * Ahh, good old 40-man raids...
    * Tranquilizing Shot has since become a standard hunter ability.

Naxxramas

* Grand Widow Faerlina periodically enrages, which requires Widow's Embrace (via mind control or killing an add) to remove.

Ulduar

* XT-002 Deconstructor has Tympanic Tantrum, which can be averted by forcing him into his Evocation Phase.
* Elder Stonebark's Fists of Stone is a type of enrage which can kill an unprepared tank.

### Evocation Phase

The Evocation Phase is a time when the boss stops attacking for some amount of time, or until condition, and is more vulnerable to damage. This is the time to pop long cooldowns and go to work.

#### Examples

* Magmaw's head phase is the time for everyone (even healers) to go to town on the boss.

### Eyebeams Pew Pew

This attack comes in two varieties.

The first type, and nicest, is where the boss enters a periodic phase where he emits some beam-like attack, usually while slowly spinning in a circle.

The second are Omega Beam type rays which actively home in on one or more players (and will hurt any innocents in the line of fire). Either way, it's time to Run Away Little Girl.

### Examples

* Rohash uses an attack called Wind Blast to try and knock people off his platform every 30 seconds or so. He spins in a 90-degree arc.

### Gear Check

A Gear Check is an encounter designed to be winnable via numbers: the sturdiness of the raid's tanks, the damage per second produced by the raid's damage dealers, and the ability of the healers to sustain the raid. A boss in such an encounter has few to no gimmicks but a middle-of-the-road (or sometimes aggressive) Doomsday Clock.

#### Examples

Naxxramas

* Patchwerk is the archetypical gear check.

### Group Hug

When it's absolutely vital and Position Matters, the raid can gather together and bunch up on each other in ways that put college kids and clown cars to shame. The usual reason for this tactic is to counter Meteor or to make it easy to obey Don't Stand in the Fire.

The opposing tactic is Run Away Little Girl or Hide Behind the Pillar.

#### Examples

Theralion's ground phase calls for two Group Hugs, the melee and the ranged. This gives maximum survivability for the constant meteor attacks Valiona is throwing.

### Hard Mode

Prior to starting the encounter, or perhaps in the course of the encounter itself, the raid can perform some action which enhances the boss's capabilities or makes the encounter more difficult. The usual reward for doing so is better loot, but on occasion this is needed to advance to an even greater accomplishment - such as a final final boss.

This can create additional complications for raiders, such as Don't Stand in the Fire, that weren't present in the normal encounter.

#### Examples

* 5-man dungeons have a "Heroic" setting, introduced in Burning Crusade. All mobs in the instance are level-appropriate to a party of level 85 adventurers, and drop better loot than normal.
* Cataclysm raids now have separate "Heroic" setting, which works in a similar fashion. Some raids continue to have specific implementations of a hard mode, usually differing in mechanics per boss, and often optional.

### Hateful Strike

Aside from normal damage to the tank, the boss will also periodically (or constantly) do damage to a well-defined nearby target. This can be the #2 man on the threat meter, the melee with the highest HP, whoever won an Abyss Crystal last Tuesday, or whatever.

If the damage is a constant number divided amongst the raiders in its effective area, this is Meteor. Charge Spam is a more aggressive variant of the basic idea.

#### Examples

Karazhan

* The Curator. Notable for being a Boss With Adds that also does this.

Gruul's Lair

* Gruul

Naxxramas

* Patchwerk

### Hide Behind the Pillar

A variant of Run Away Little Girl, where just getting to sufficient range or running faster than something else won't help you. The boss begins charging his lazor, and the raid is expected to take cover behind something suitably sturdy.

This is sometimes a feature of the Pull From Hell, where the raid must hide behind cover or get pwned by the boss before the tank is able to pick up.

#### Examples

Icecrown Citadel

* Sindragosa will ice block players, and the rest of the raid is expected to take cover behind them during the air phase.

Pit of Saron

* Garfrost throws chunks of saronite at a randomly-chosen player, which become a line-of-sight barrier against his Stacking Debuff.

Serpentshrine Cavern

* The usual hiding spot against the Lurker Below's Eyebeams Pew Pew is under the water.

Naxxramas

* Sapphiron will occasionally freeze players in blocks of ice... thus forming a barrier behind which the other players must then immediately hide.

### Meteor

A Meteor attack is one whose damage is evenly distributed among whoever's in the area defined for it - usually a spot in front of the boss. The more people who are present to take it to the face, the less damage each person receives. This allows such attacks to be survivable in a group.

Compare Hateful Strike. The countering tactic is a Group Hug.

#### Examples

Baradin Hold

* Argaloth does a Meteor Slash attack which also prompts a Tank Swap.

Bastion of Twilight
* Valiona and Theralion love meteor attacks.

Black Rock Caverns

* Certain elemental trash mobs use a meteor-style attack.

Throne of the Four Winds

* Nezir uses a meteor-style AoE attack as his ultimate attack.

### Miniboss

The boss is assisted by one or more additional mobs, who rank as bosses in their own right but frequently have few to no special gimmicks of their own, and less HP to boot.

These bosses are sometimes optional; leaving one or more alive activates Hard Mode.

#### Examples

Bastion of Twilight

* Halfus Wyrmbreaker has a rotating roster of helpers, either individual dragons or whelps. While a dragon is up, Halfus is penalized in some fashion, but the raid must tank the dragon. Killing a dragon puts a debuff on Halfus which increases damage dealt.

### Multiboss

A Multiboss encounter consists of two or more actual bosses, rather than just a Boss With Adds. Tanks must usually be dedicated to each boss in the encounter, and the DPS will generally focus fire on one at a time.

If the bosses are homogenous or have their HP pools linked in some fashion, you're fighting Conjoined Twins.

#### Examples

Throne of the Four Winds

* The Conclave of Wind is made of three bosses with their own health pools, tactics and requirements.

### Phase Transition

It's a floor wax! It's a dessert topping! No, it's a Phase Transition! Common to virtually all boss encounters, this is a condition where the boss switches from one form of attack (or one vulnerability) to another. Some bosses have a distinct set of phases which occur in a set order, while others will oscillate from one phase to another and back again.

This is what occurs when players break the Add-Powered Bubble.

#### Examples

Too numerous to list.

Black Temple
* Illidan Stormrage, one of the most complex fights in the game, has no less than five phases.

### Position Matters

The boss encounter seems straightforward. Tank (or tanks), healers, and DPS all push their buttons. But, something else causes the raid to go south. Would just changing where people are laid out do any good? More often than not, yes.

Sometimes this is done to avoid a Stacking Debuff.

Compare Don't Stand in the Fire, Don't Stand Next to Other People, and Group Hug.

#### Examples

The Blackwing Descent trash will require tanks and melee to precisely position themselves.

### Pull From Hell

The Pull From Hell is found whenever there is difficulty just starting the boss encounter without totally losing it. The reasons for this can be many, but they all boil down to a complicated set of actions that are required to engage the boss with any hope of success.

#### Examples

Gruul's Lair

* The King Maulgar encounter was usually started by the mage, who would Pyroblast his tanking target. The other tanks would then pick up their respective bosses, usually with the help of Misdirection.
    * Woe to any mage that put their Blink button right next to Pyroblast...

Ulduar

* Auriaya requires that the raid drop some threat-generating dingus on the ground in front of her as she paths, and then Hide Behind the Pillar in a Group Hug - because if they don't, her adds will zerg the raid into oblivion.

Vault of Archavon

* Emalon requires that one tank pick up the main boss, while the offtank manages four adds (and periodically grabs new ones that spawn), then position everything properly.

### Resistance Fight

Sometimes the boss doesn't do as much physical damage as magic damage - flame breath, frost auras, and so forth - and the encounter is basically unbeatable without mitigating this damage. In such cases, the MT, all tanks, or even all raid members are expected to wear alternative gear that provides resistance against one or more schools of magic. Consumables, enchantments, and class-specific abilities may be used to push resistance scores even higher.

#### Examples

Molten Core

* Ragnaros did fire damage, requiring the tanks to craft specialized resistance sets to compensate.

Temple of Ahn'Qiraj

* C'thun can pour on the nature damage; raid members are expected to have some degree of resistance, although this is true of the entire instance.

Naxxramas

* Sapphiron does a large amount of frost damage, which may be reduced by a tank wearing appropriate gear.

Ulduar

* Hodir's Frozen Blows ability is much easier to handle with frost resistance.

### Resonance

Some bosses are lazy, and don't like to move. Or they're rooted in place and can't. Either way, it would be too easy to let the ranged DPS sit back and wand the boss to death.... so the encounter has a device by which the raid suffers if someone isn't actively working on the boss.

Raid damage is the most common punishment, and in some encounters the boss will actually knock back players - or make it unwise for them to stay close the entire time - just to add a challenge.

When a boss's adds root themselves and start emitting damage, Don't Stand in the Fire.

#### Examples

Throne of the Four Winds

* Each of the three bosses in the Conclave of Wind will put up a raid-wide debuff and start damage ticks if someone isn't on their platform.

### Run Away Little Girl

Sometimes, the boss gets stronger during the encounter. Sometimes, You Are the Bomb. Either way, it's time to flee for your miserable life. The character must move to a safe spot, or continuously move to avoid the boss or some other sort of negative effect.

This is the usual tactic to avoiding Eyebeams Pew Pew.

If the safe spot is some feature of the terrain, this becomes Hide Behind the Pillar.

Examples

Shadowfang Keep

* Lord Walden has a red-light/green-light mechanic, where players must either hold still or keep moving continuously to avoid bad things.

Throne of the Four Winds

* Players on Rohash's platform must avoid the numerous tornadoes sweeping around them.

### Sacrifice

The boss grabs, impales, or otherwise immobilizes one character, chosen at random. This character will usually experience a spike in incoming damage, which must be healed through or otherwise mitigated. Sometimes the consequence of being the bomb for long enough.

If the raid can work to free their comrade, this becomes Web Wrap.

### Examples

Grim Batol

* Forgemaster Throngus will sometimes impale a player. Recent patches allow the impaled person to continue healing or otherwise casting.

### Spinning Top

The boss uses a Whirlwind.. but he doesn't stand still! Instead he will come after you, either charging random raid members or simply moving (fairly fast) in a relatively unpredictable direction. Being near enough to him will cause damage, so Run Away Little Girl.

#### Examples

Deadmines

* Foe Reaper 5000 has a nasty habit of targeting a player's current location with this.

### Stacking Debuff

The boss or his adds have a debuff which they can place on some (or all) members of the raid. In some variants, this is actually a buff on the boss. Either way, it has multiple levels and the raid must take care not to do things which exacerbate it.

Raiders can sometimes Stand in the Good Stuff or Hide Behind the Pillar to eliminate or reduce the debuff. When inflicted only on tanks, this is a common mechanic for enforcing a Tank Swap.

#### Examples

Throne of the Four Winds

* Anshal's adds stack up a debuff which will overwhelm DPS on their platform unless they are killed.
* Nezir has a debuff which amplifies frost damage, necessitating that tanks and healers periodically get off his platform.

### Stand in the Good Stuff

The encounter has conveniently provided the raid with a beneficial spot in which to stand, either as a result of actions by the boss or his adds, or sometimes by killing adds. Occasionally the raid must kill adds which would otherwise buff the boss to receive this benefit.

If this is a permanent feature of the terrain in the encounter, this is a variant of Hide Behind the Pillar.

#### Examples

Blackwing Descent

* Arcanotron's Power Generator effect is useful for DPS and healers, as it boosts damage and mana regeneration.

### Tank Swap

Raid encounters in the Wrath of the Lich King expansion almost universally take some steps to justify multiple tanks, no matter how many bosses are present. One gimmick is the Tank Swap, where a Stacking Debuff or other combat condition necessitates that one tank stop building threat on the boss and his partner immediately taunt, repeatedly through the fight.

Often, a 25-man version of a raid will have a Tank Swap mechanic that a 10-man version lacked.

#### Examples

Baradin Hold

* Tanks must swap after Argaloth uses his Meteor attack.

Throne of the Four Winds

* Tanks on Anshal and Nezir must swap with each other to avoid Nezir's frost debuff.

### Trash Gauntlet

Sometimes the boss just isn't ready to fight you when you arrive on the scene. He's over there, the raid is over here, and between the two are legions of trash mobs. The raid must overcome them in order to start working on the boss.

Different from Add-Powered Bubble in that you can't really work on the boss at all until you dispose of the adds.

### Examples

Naxxramas

* Gothik spawns several waves of adds before he teleports down from his balcony.

Eye of Eternity

* Malygos phase 2 consists of him flying around invulnerably while the raid alternates between killing his adds and running to the magic shields which periodically spawn.

Ulduar

* Thorim has a gauntlet, where a small group must assault his position while another group fends off waves of dwarves in the arena. Reaching him quickly enough activates Hard Mode.

### Vehicle Gimmick

Sometimes regular heroes and their badass gear just aren't enough. Sometimes, the boss is just too big, or just too aerial. Then it's time for the raid to hop aboard something (or someone) and defeat evil with a shiny new action bar. This is a Vehicle Gimmick.

The effectiveness of the raid's vehicles usually scales with gear score, regardless of how good that gear might be in the player's typical role. Players therefore equip items with the highest possible item level when the encounter starts and ends in vehicles.

Examples of this are much throttled back since Wrath, possibly due to player complaints.

#### Examples

Blackwing Descent

* Bringing Magmaw down involves briefly jumping on his head, and using a specific spell available while up there.

Eye of Eternity

* Malygos is the archetypical example, and included a daily quest with identical mechanics to let players familiarize themselves with the mechanic. Most didn't.

### Void Zone

A Void Zone is a spot on the floor where periodic damage ticks or other bad things happen, and which players should avoid.

Tactically, a Void Zone can be used to avoid a worse fate, like a raid-wide stun. Stand in the void just before the stun finishes casting.

#### Examples

See Don't Stand in the Fire for most of the relevant examples.

Stonecore

* Kiting Azil's adds through her void zones is the easiest way to kill them.

### Web Wrap

A randomly-chosen player is encased in something, such as spiderwebs, ice, or a bone cage. It is the raid's duty to free their friend from captivity before he dies.

If the raid is powerless to free the character (but may usually continue to heal him through the effect), this is Sacrifice. Being in a Group Hug can sometimes help the DPS get to their comrade more quickly. The encounter might provide a safety net against this attack if the raid can just Stand in the Good Stuff or Hide Behind the Pillar.

#### Example

Rom'ogg Bonecrusher puts chains on the entire party in Black Rock Caverns. The chains must be DPSed, and the party must run away, or face a wipe.

### Whirlwind

Everything's going fine. The tank has solid threat on the boss. The melee DPS are properly behind the boss to maximize their damage. And then... he starts spinning like Wonder Woman, and the melee dies! What happened? The boss has used a Whirlwind.

Healers love it when melee is smart enough to run out of this. Melee loves it when healers are buff enough to keep them up through it. Tanks hate it because as a general rule they're stuck with the boss no matter where they go.

If the melee merely has to run out, this is a relatively low-risk danger. It gets worse if the boss is really a Spinning Top.

#### Examples

Scarlet Monastery

* Herod's "Blades of Light!" voice emote is an evocative reminder of this trope.
The Nexus

* The first boss (whose identity varies depending on your faction) uses this attack.

### You Are the Bomb

An attack, debuff or other condition is inflicted on some character in the raid - sometimes at random, sometimes as part of an AOE. Either way, this character becomes dangerous to the rest of the raid if he stays too close. All he can do is get to a safe distance (but not so far that the healers can't reach him) and ride it out.

#### Examples

* During Theralion's ground phase, a random party member will receive the Engulfing Magic debuff, and must either stop casting (if near other people) or run away to avoid doing massive AoE damage.
