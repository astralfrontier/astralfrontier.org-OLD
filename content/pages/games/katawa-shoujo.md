# Katawa Shoujo

[Katawa Shoujo](http://katawa-shoujo.com/) is a "visual novel" - a story told through a game with text, pictures and music. A typical visual novel allows the player a limited amount of control over the protagonist's story, in the form of choices. Because many such games involve "routes" that establish relationships between a male protagonist and various female characters, they are often called dating sims.

Like many VNs, Katawa Shoujo includes erotic content, but this can be disabled in the options.

The premise of the game is that the lead character is sent to a special school thanks to a congenital heart defect. The girls he meets there suffer from assorted disabilities of their own (blindness, deafness, missing limbs, burn scars) as well as psychological complications - not always related to their disability. Through their interactions with the protagonist, the player learns more about them, and perhaps about the nature of disability and the human spirit.

More information is available at the [TVTropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KatawaShoujo) for the game.

The game is free to download and will install on Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux. There is an "Act 1" demo if you just want to try out a bit, though the best material requires a full playthrough.

#### My Experience

I played the game without a guide, and managed to get Hanako's good end. I admit that I was targeting Hanako was the most interesting character to me personally, and I was gratified that my choices turned out to be the right ones.

#### Should You Play It?

If you are someone who doesn't mind guiding a male protagonist through a relationship with a girl, and want to see a really well written example of the genre, yes.

If you dismiss such games as "fap material", try this one - it might change your mind.
