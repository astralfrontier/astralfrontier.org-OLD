# Tribes: Ascend

"You should ignore generator defense"
-------------------------------------

This is stupid. Here's why:

* Two classes (Technician and Doombringer) explicitly depend on the generator being up for their defensive gimmicks (turrets and force fields, respectively) to work. If you have an argument that these classes are useless even with gens up, I want to hear it - a good DMB can wreck the enemy's Flag O if they aren't careful.
* Your static defenses, like turrets, depend on the generators. These aren't amazing, but they count for something. Several maps have static force fields that come down with the gens, allowing cappers alternate (and better) routes.
* Your inventory and vehicle stations are down without generators.

All this for the cost of parking a Technician in the gen room and having him come out once in awhile to 'nade passers-by. I understand this is a costly move if you're on a 5v5 map or something, but put your big boy pants on and do it on anything larger.

How to: Gen defense with TCN
----------------------------

Loadout: Thumper and Repair Gun. Motion sensor mines. Safety Third

I prefer the Motion sensor mines to the fire-and-forget repair kit when doing gen defense. Almost every map with a generator has two main routes to it, and between two and four variations on how to ultimately get to the generator itself. With four deployable sensors, I put out two as a perimeter at the entrances - the only time those will trigger if a hostile is actually inbound for the gens. I put two more in the immediate doorways to the gen room, so that I know if an enemy was shut off by someone in the field before getting all the way in.

I deploy two light turrets wherever they'll get the best coverage - ideally covering both the gen room interior and the entrances if possible - and try to minimize the chances that someone can plink at my turrets without also triggering the motion sensors.

The sensor perimeter lets me be out and about in the field, repairing turrets or sensors, and still be in easy reach of the generator before a random Brute finishes killing it. It also makes a great early warning system against INF - if you are in line of sight as an infiltrator crosses your mine, you can fire at the sound and kill him a good percentage of the time.

How to: TCN vs. BRU
-------------------

This depends heavily on the map you're on. Brutes are one of the most brutally effective Gen-hating classes in the game. Fractal grenades can totally shut down unprepared defenders, and the Brute lugs around plenty of heavy weapons with splash damage. If you're defending in anything other than Technician, you'll have to run for a repair gun should he actually make it to the gen (or if his INF buddy does so).

My favorite maps have high ceilings and twisty corridors to work with. The key is to use the thumper's ballistic arc and splash damage to make shots that the Brute can't respond to if you're out of LOS. You don't have a lot of armor, so you should be darting out, taking a shot that will whittle down his health, then making sure you're behind a wall when he returns fire. It's vital to have your radar up so you can track and predict his movements. If you see him coming toward a door, time a shot so it'll hit him when he comes into view.

Force Fields
------------

You can put up multiple force fields around the flag, which do damage to any cappers passing through. A force field can be knocked over in 2-3 spinfusor shots from any range, however. A sneakier tactic I've seen is for a Doombringer to drop a force field right as the flag capper is coming in, preventing them from damaging it beforehand. This requires that the DB player be aware of the cap attempt.
