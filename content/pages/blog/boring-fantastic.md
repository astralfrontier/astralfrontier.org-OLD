Summary: Your job is to save the world, yadda yadda.

# The Boring Fantastic

Many games share fantasy elements.
That's a given - we have elves, dwarves, and halflings thanks to Tolkien.
Much fantastic fiction builds on a shared mythology taught to us as we grow up.
To accomplish suspension of disbelief, fantasy tends to leverage the power
of these shared stories.
There's a risk to this approach - fantasy stories, including fantasy RPGs,
box themselves into this framework. __They become boring.__

I'm going to argue two things:

1. The fantasy genre is carefully balanced between familiarity and repetition, and
2. New roleplaying game rules are a vital part of creating something really new.

#### New bottles for old wine

![Fiction Rule of Thumb](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fiction_rule_of_thumb.png){: align="right"}

Save the world. Rescue the princess. Epic trilogies. Cunning wizards.
Games like [Dungeons & Dragons] started with from familiar European stories.
Other games drawing from Asian mythology followed such as
[Exalted], [Weapons of the Gods], and [Feng Shui].
These games work because the GM can tell his players,
"there are elves and dwarves and halflings" (or
"there kung fu fighters and scholars and old men with long white eyebrows")
and the players understand.

Every setting comes with its own twists, turns, and novelties.
Unfortunately, they are often forced to be small variations at best.

> "You can play the akak'kri race."
> "Well what are those?"
> "Uh, basically dragon-men."

> "He's wielding a dwarven urgrosh."
> "What does it look like?"
> "It's a rod with an axe on both ends."

Why is all this necessary?

_The players must be able to construct an accurate mental model
of the creator's universe in order to navigate within it_.

Players choose their characters' actions. If they don't know
what they can choose, or can't predict the obvious outcomes,
their characters can come off as idiots or madmen.
If the GM intervenes to tell the player something they missed,
the overall narrative is preserved at the cost of a break
in the flow of storytelling.
If such interventions are frequent, players may feel they've lost
their [agency](http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/48645).

To enjoy the campaign, the players must have enough information to act.
Adopting too many genre conventions provides that information
at the expense of originality.

#### The language of games

![How Standards Proliferate](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png){: align="right"}

Imagine a squad of PC soldiers meets a pack of evil monsters.
A fight breaks out. How should the characters pick their targets?
The answer is "it depends on what rules you are using".

In D&D, you might alpha-strike one target after another.
In GURPS, you might spread your forces and try to inflict a few
early wounds. Why the difference?
_In D&D, wounded enemies can fight at full power until they reach 0 HP,
while in GURPS, they can't._
The smart tactics of one universe can become stupid or even suicidal
in another.

And why is that?
Because what you are modeling varies from game to game.

Early RPGs had new rules for every game.
This led to an abundance of crappy rules,
because _most people don't have a lot of practice writing game mechanics._
This is normal and expected, but undesirable.
These rules couldn't evolve very far because of their laser focus
on a given scenario.
[Chainmail] came with wargame rules for mass combat, man-to-man, and jousting,
but not many rules for wooing princesses or administering the complex
economies of your kingdom.

More flexible, and "generic", rules were a later incarnation.
These included [Champions] (and the more inclusive "Hero"),
[GURPS], and even some D20 variations like Mutants & Masterminds.
White Wolf's "Storyteller" system powered their entire line
of games, from gritty gothic horror to high-powered epic fantasy.
Systems like Cortex and [ORE] don't even come with a setting attached,
just a toolkit and some thoughts from the developers. Some games
had an "effects-based" attitude, where you bought mechanical benefits
and justified them as you wished; others tried to represent how
things worked in the real world, and extrapolated to cover fantastic
elements.

The central truth of RPG game rules is this:
_they provide a vocabulary through which players can express their intent,
and that vocabulary is always limited._
"I hit him with my sword" is a narrative description;
"I roll an attack, which hits AC 15 or lower, doing 2d6+6 slashing damage"
is its expression in mechanical terms. At the end of the day,
your language for communicating intent boils down to what
the game designers anticipated, plus whatever the GM can think up.

__What about houseruling?__\\
I hate people who say "you can't blame the rules for not
catering to your interests, you can just house-rule whatever
is missing or unworkable!" Yeah, and I can drive nails with
my shoe. Doesn't stop me from preferring a good hammer.

#### Making things not boring

Rather than departing too far from fantasy norms - and losing that
sense of the familiar that makes your setting comprehensible -
many newer games are extracting the essence of something and mixing
in other ideas.

Just as an example, look at Supers, Mecha, WW2, and Cyberpunk.
[Camelot Trigger] is the Arthurian mythos with giant robots.
[Godlike] mixes WW2 with supers.
The Lovecraftian Mythos is a popular candidate for such adaptions,
adding a taste of cosmic evil to everything from mecha combat ([CthulhuTech])
and cyberpunk ([GURPS CthulhuPunk]) to WW2 ([Achtung! Cthulhu]).
Each of these games combines a couple of familiar ideas, and
each are quite different.

Conventional RPG rules model things. This sword does so much damage,
this character has so many HP. Those models come with attendant
assumptions that break badly when taken out of context, and
"out of context" is exactly where the most interesting games
can be found.

You achieve better results by writing game rules that
model _specific tones or styles of play_.
Worlds might change, cavemen might give way to Lensmen,
but the meta-rules - how narratives are supposed to work in your
chosen game - do not.
[Fate Core] is explicitly built to approximate heroic fiction, no matter the
specific setting in which it happens. [Savage Worlds] has
"Fast! Furious! Fun!" as its motto, regardless of which savage world
you're using.

I believe, then, that the most interesting games are formed
from __the juxtaposition of familiar elements in unfamiliar
combinations__, powered by game rules that __enforce a mood
rather than model a world__. Fortunately we are seeing an
explosion of such games. Time will tell how they are received.
