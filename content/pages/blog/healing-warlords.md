# Healing Warlords of Draenor

I'm going to talk about what it's like for me healing in the new World of Warcraft expansion, Warlords of Draenor. I'm not going to talk about the story, because I haven't seen it all yet.

I am going to talk about healing even though I haven't seen all of that yet. I haven't done LFR, and I haven't joined a regular raiding group for non-LFR endgame raids. But the reasons I haven't done so are part of what I want to discuss.

I'm also going to look at this from the perspective of a Final Fantasy XIV player. FFXIV solves a lot of the same problem Warcraft does ("be a big general-purpose fantasy MMO borrowing heavily from an existing game franchise"), and it did go through a very rough patch in 1.0. The game was almost entirely rewritten, and it now deserves the universal acclaim it has received.

So what's it like healing in Warlords of Draenor?

### Gearing up

I'm a miner/engineer. This is because engineering used to be the optimal profession for my class and spec when raid healing. But Blizzard changed the assumptions that made that true - the hand enchants that Engineering provides are no longer an option - so all I can do now to further my efforts is to create item level 640 epic goggles.

Can I do that immediately? No - the materials needed to craft almost anything are now on a daily cooldown. The new "garrison" feature in Warlords produces extra items, and I can buy more (at an exorbitant exchange rate) from an NPC vendor in the garrison. If I want to make these goggles, or for that matter anything else of practical use in Engineering, I'm going to be logging in every day, pushing a button, and waiting.

Furthermore, I can only wear the goggles plus two other pieces. You used to be able to equip as many crafted items as you liked. Warlords put a cap of 3 crafted items in place, which means I could wear (say) a ring and a neck piece, but not a ring, a neck, and boots in addition to my goggles.

If my guild wants a healer and wants to just combine efforts to craft me raid-ready gear, that's simply no longer an option. Alright, well what is left?

* Dungeon runs for loot
* Apexis shard turnins
* Follower missions

Apexis shards trickle in as mob loot at level 100, unless you're doing one of the two possible daily missions for either 800 or 1000 shards. The equippable items' costs start at around 5000 shards per piece. That's a week of dailies per piece, and only for the slots where items are available.

Follower missions deliver item level 615 items once you've reached the point where missions reward gear at all, and they're blues with random stats. That's enough to barely get you into the door of heroics, but not enough to make you raid-ready.So in general, dungeon runs are what you need to fill all slots.

### Dungeon runs

The LFG queue system, put in place a few expansions back, is a familiar one: hit the button, pick the dungeons you want, and join a queue. If you're a DPS player, expect this to take 30-40  minutes. If you're a healer, expect this to take 5 minutes. If you're a tank, expect 1 minute or less.

Why is this? Unsurprisingly, it's because most players want to do damage. This has always been true, in every game. Once I might have speculated on motives. I might have said "players are lazy", or that [healers have the hardest job to do](/games/healing-is-the-hardest-role) of the tank/healer/DPS trinity. DPS was traditionally the easy job. You push your buttons, you stand out of the fire, you kill the boss, you get loot.

These days DPS have a lot to do in a dungeon run. There's more fire to stand out of. There's more complicated mechanics in boss fights. There's all-new mechanics like those found in the [Grimrail Depot](http://www.wowhead.com/guide=2666/grimrail-depot-dungeon-strategy-guide) fight with Nitrogg Thundertower. But from what I have seen, getting DPS to do these things correctly is a challenge.

The outcome is that my only viable gearing strategy - doing dungeons - forces me into the instanced content, where I'm at the mercy of other players for advancement to happen. Well, okay. Am I able to at least heal that content effectively?

### The new healing model

You can see Joystiq's coverage of the "new healing model" [here](http://wow.joystiq.com/2014/03/07/watcher-on-health-and-healing-changes-in-warlords-of-draenor/). The short version is "healers will do less overall healing, and little to no smart healing from their spells".

That would be fine if incoming damage was also scaled down. Is it? In my most recent heroic instances, I watched people lose literally half their health to individual attacks. There was a lot of fire on the ground to walk in, and all of it did very aggressive damage. So I would have to say no, it's not. I feel like I need those big healing spells still. Heroic should be hard, I get that, but it should not be hard to the point where we lose 2-3 people per boss fight.

No tank in the world can keep DPS from standing in fire. If the DPS are bad at their jobs, I could at least compensate a little for that. That's no longer the case. If you stand in fire, you're going to die, and I can't help you. But that puts pressure on me, because trying to heal you up costs me time that I could be using for tank healing. And I have lost tanks on heroics, even well-geared ones that I've worked with before, simply because incoming damage was too high.

Based on the rate of incoming damage, the dev statement that the healing changes are meant to ["replace testing reaction time with testing decision-making"](https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/441963850942783488) has failed to live up to its promise. There is no decision to make in 5-man right now - the decision has been made. At any given moment, it's either "the tank" or "all the DPS standing in fire". But reaction time definitely still matters.

### The root of all evil: game balance

So to recap: my options for gearing up have been narrowed. The major option for gearing to raid readiness now depends on my ability to do my primary job (healing) at the highest possible difficulty level. Why the highest? Because starting out is where my gear is weakest and my experience with the encounters is missing. Better gear makes the same encounters easier.

If this is such a bad game experience, then why did Blizzard do things this way?

In short, I think it's because they are trying to balance their game on the back of a set of flawed foundations. Let's look at those, and the ways in which other games (like FFXIV) have solved those problems. What is Blizzard's game play built upon?

1. Small groups and large groups clearing instanced content. To keep things interesting, risk must be present. But when any mistake can kill the player or wipe the group, fewer players in the group means less risk. In FFXIV, a "light party" consists of 4 people (one tank, one healer, two damage dealers). The small raid in Warcraft is 10 people, while in FFXIV a "full party" is 8 people (two tanks, two healers, four damage dealers). This may seem like a simple change, but the feeling it creates is very different.
2. Tanks, healers, and damage dealers having meaningful roles. In earlier expansions, raid leaders doing familiar content would bring fewer healers than normal to maximize their DPS. FFXIV solves this with the job system. If Bob's White Mage isn't the right job for this week's raid, Bob can job change to something more useful rather than being benched or having to bring an alt. Rather than driving up demand for raid healers by capping their effectiveness, Square gave the players more versatility.
3. Driving encounters toward deliberation rather than reaction time. This was solved in FFXIV with a global cooldown of 2.5 seconds, not 1.5. This extra second gives a much more measured feeling to encounters, giving players plenty of time to think about what they're doing next.

Every expansion has brought a new healing model to Warcraft. Warlords of Draenor is no different. Unfortunately, Blizzard has built so much atop a shaky foundation that making real and effective change to the root causes of their problems seems unlikely.
