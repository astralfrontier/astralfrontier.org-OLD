9. Blizzard's characters do everything, and no player characters are involved.
8. The trailer will be far more epic than the experience itself.
7. Content will be available immediately via BitTorrent.
6. Initial movie will spin off into 60-minute daily TV episodes, which are just random rearrangements of familiar elements.
5. There's no sequel, just a series of deleted scenes and extended editions.
4. No matter what happens, the Alliance and the Horde will just keep fighting!
3. The movie will be balanced for viewer-vs.-viewer Internet forum arguments, rather than people who just go to enjoy the movie itself.
