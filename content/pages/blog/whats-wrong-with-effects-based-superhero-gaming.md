Summary: Why effects-based super RPGs have it backwards.

# What's Wrong With Effect-Based Superhero Gaming?

I've been thinking about this more and more as I play Link in *Fate Accelerated*. I've played or run *Champions*, *GURPS Supers*, *Brave New World*, and built characters in *M&M*, *Icons*, and more. Some of these systems are "effects-based": you buy Energy Blast or whatever for X points, and it does damage, no matter what the special effect or origin might be.

This is all well and good, but one of the things I want to do is exercise my imagination. In effects-based systems, I do that up front, at character creation time: "How can I creatively justify using an Energy Blast?" That's great, but I only create a character once.

What is the alternative? In Fate, I write the special effect first: "Master of Fire manipulation". What does this do? It lets me exercise my imagination at play time - which far outweighs the time I spent on chargen. Why does it do that? Because I get to think up all the different ways I can manipulate fire. Energy Blast is one possible application, but there's more.

*Champions*, for example, makes some allowances for this. You can buy things like Variable Advantage, or a Variable Power Pool, letting you manifest any power within a given special effect. *GURPS 4th edition* introduced Modular Abilities which - for a much higher price - do the same. *Mutants & Masterminds* has its own variant (though hilariously, I was told by one M&M advocate that such things are cheese, just one edition before two of the built-in templates in the book were powered by them).

The reverse isn't true. I've rarely if ever had a character where, during play, I said "this special effect doesn't adequately describe the character, I need a new one". If that's the case, then characters should be built on cause first, consequence second.
