# Lou

<div class="orange-lightcycle-right orange-lightcycle-bottom" markdown="1">

Lou lives with his sister Nell, who is blind and paraplegic. The pair are orphans.

Because affordable health care for Nell's conditions is difficult to obtain, Lou has taken a series of less-than-desirable jobs because of their dependent benefits.

#### Personality Sound-bites

_Economics:_

"Capitalism is a game where the objective is to break the rules faster than your opponent."

"You can't innovate unless you can afford to fail."

"Wealth is an illusion. Property is nothing but atoms, and the willingness to manage them."

_Politics:_ "I'm a single-issue voter. The Democrats are clumsy and disorganized, but they're better on health care than their opponents. The private sector will take care of the rest."

_Religion:_ "I'm agnostic. Show me a god who would create a world like this and I'll spit in his eye."

#### Background

Carl Englund and Mary Hamilton met and married. They had a child - Lewis - and then separated for several years, but got back together long enough to have a second child, Cornelia (Nell for short).

Lewis grew up as an attractive but not particularly masculine boy. When the separation occurred, he chose to go with his mother Mary. These things, combined with his name, led him to be ostracized by most of the student population at his schools. His major social contact came from children in similar circumstances, most of whom gravitated to the computer program as they reached high school. Lewis became fascinated by the power and potential of computers, and the secrets they held. He was far more ambitious than his more technical fellows, and was unofficially accused of rigging grades or blackmailing bullies into leaving him or his friends alone.

Lewis' sister Cornelia was born 12 years after him. Their parents had attempted to use another child as a way to cement their marriage. Unfortunately, "Nell" was born blind, and this added stress finally drove Carl and Mary apart. When Lou was 22 and Nell was 10, an unexpected and tragic twist occurred: Nell suffered a serious injury caused by a fall, leaving her paralyzed and unable to walk. Lou was forced to take over more and more responsibility for caring for her.

Lou became Nell's official guardian a year after the accident (2005). Carl and Mary had already started finalizing divorce proceedings, and although Nell didn't talk about specifics, she was no longer willing to live with either parent. Convinced that he could depend on nobody but himself, and that Nell could depend on nobody but him, Lou filed the paperwork with his parents' consent.

Since 2005, Lou has worked as a manager at various jobs. He has been ruthless in consolidating and maintaining his position; more than one fellow executive who attempted a power grab or ouster has found incriminating evidence released at an inopportune moment. Lou has taken jobs in which he has little personal interest for the sake of health benefits or good money, all of which go to keeping his sister as healthy and happy as possible.

In 2007, both Carl and Mary died in a car crash. The authorities ruled it an accident. Neither sibling is particularly talkative about the incident.
