# 2013-11-04 Discussion

Phil says, "I'm not sure why you'd conclude that getting a whole new technology dumped in your lap is a sign they're about to fire you. But you'll have a chance to talk about it with Alan."

You say, "most of what I sent is intended to help you plan. if it's not helpful, or if you want other details, let me know. But at this point I can tell you how Lou would react in a variety of scenarios."

Phil says, "You'll get a call back from Alan a few minutes after you send him that page. We need to play out that conversation, but I have to wonder, are you going to HIDE your discovery of the laser lab?"

You say, "from him? No. from the general public? Absolutely yes. Just because I have fears doesn't mean I'm going to be indiscreet."

You say, "Lou's angle for that conversation is:  we want to succeed at the task you gave us. To do that, we had to go digging for the computers, software, and documentation for an unknown apparatus."

You say, "OOC, I expect Alan Bradley to be TOTALLY HIP to the problem of being locked out of the details of a system you're working with."

----

To elaborate on why Lou's worried about being fired:

1. When we discussed AAI's situation, we were in month 11 of a 12-month window after ENCOM had bought AAI.
2. What happens to AAI employees was up in the air after this point.
3. As mentioned, this laser task comes with a lot more secrecy than any officially-mandated task would reasonably have. At minimum, Lou would have expected that a laser engineer would have been present at the Arcade to supervise the transfer of materials and make sure nothing was damaged. We shouldn't have had to do detective work to retrieve this stuff. In addition, the computers - which operate the apparatus - are not present. If the goal was to make the laser work from start to finish, it'd have been reasonable for us to have them.
4. A different goal - simply to document the physical apparatus for someone else taking over the project - is consistent with observed facts. We were partitioned from the rest of the system because we had no need-to-know. In the case where we were slated to hand off research & leave the company, partitioning sensitive knowledge would be normal.

In short, with the 12-month cutoff point, we at AAI are either "in" or "out". The actions to date feel like "out".

That said, Lou ISN'T a fully rational, dispassionate character here. He IS worried (unreasonably) about losing a comfortable enough job, he IS worried about his sister, and he WILL see things as more of a threat than they really are at times.

Bill rolls back in. If you got email, does explanation on 'why fear firing' make more sense?

Phil says, "Mostly."

Phil says, "Irrespective of whatever was GOING to happen, you've kind of forced Alan's hand."

You say, "Well, I do feel bad about that. Antagonizing a board member of your parent company is not a survival strategy, I realize. But based on Lou's understanding of events, this is good for Alan too."

Phil says, "I'll be interested to see you convince him of that."

Phil . o O ( he said, without any hint of menace. )

You say, "So here are the key things I think he might be concerned about."

You say, "1. Did we leak information? Not really - the only guys who knew we were there are ENCOM, and our presence was logged. Nobody from outside the company knows more than they did yesterday. If they weren't suspicious about a van pulling up and new locks and fences, they won't be more suspicious about 3 random guys."

You say, "2. Did we learn The Secret? Again, not really. We don't have any understanding of the laser's real potential, just information that would have been obvious in retrospect - that Kevin Flynn built a laser on his own time, that he had help (necessary because he lacked the specific engineering expertise in this area), and that it was in operation at some point."

You say, "3. Did we overstep our authority? Arguably. At this point it's a question of Alan's personality. Does he want us to follow orders, or does he want people who operate on their own authority to do a task well? That I can't answer."

You say, "4. Did we need to do all this, strictly speaking? Again, arguably. I believed that we couldn't have gotten the laser running in any short amount of time without the computers, drivers, and documentation of some kind. To me, the difficulty with Alan is another question: _were we really supposed to?_"

Phil says, "I don't want to have the full conversation right now, but one point he'll bring up: who owns Flynn's laser?"

Mike says, "The evasive response Lou got to the question "Is this really ENCOM's?" is a data point here.  It would've been a sign that we were already asking questions that weren't strictly part of the charter "see if it can be made to work"."

Phil says, "Who do YOU think owns this laser, that Flynn built? Who has the right to patent improvements that he might have made to the G-B process, 25 years ago, which nobody found until long after he was declared legally dead?"

Phil says, "Does that consideration inform your analysis of Alan's motives?"

Mike says, "The fact that there was almost certainly another person involved strongly alters that calculus."

You say, "Oh yes. But ultimately all answers point to ENCOM and/or Sam Flynn, which at this point is the same thing. Let me explain."

Mike says, "Well, there's at least one other person /known/ to have laser expertise who could conceivably had access to that lab, and Alan is possibly the only person on the planet outside of the person themselves who would have any idea about /that/."

Mike says, "But that's OOC at this point, sorta."

You say, "ENCOM is /acting/ like it owns the laser. They roped off the arcade, took the thing out, packed it up, and dropped it in our laps as a project on the company's dime. Further, if it was Kevin Flynn's private property (nevermind that it would have been built during the time those patents were active), it would have reverted to his estate upon his legal death, and Sam would inherit it. A possible co-owner would be the laser tech that helped him, but unless they're also ENCOM, the company could have a VERY STRONG CASE that they don't have a right to the patented IP it represents."

You say, "if Alan is trying to go all Lucius Fox on us - moving the laser to an anonymous warehouse and trying to Special Projects it off the books - then we haven't actively compromised that effort, just tied ourselves more closely to it."

Mike says, "Another point: patent law works on /published/ knowledge.  The lot of this is unpublished, as far as we know (at least, Williams hasn't heard of any further published papers on the G-B process), so it's still very much up for grabs patent-wise, and as the owner of the physical property, Sam Flynn and/or Encom would have first claim over any patents filed based on it, and that clock doesn't start ticking until it hits the USPTO."

Mike says, "or the journals, whichever comes first."

You say, "okay.  s/patented/patentable/"

Phil says, "That analysis is mostly correct, but 'Sam Flynn' and 'ENCOM' are not the same thing, in terms of ownership. If Flynn owns it and Encom doesn't then that's a big deal for Encom. If Encom owns it, then the other shareholders have an interest in its disposition beyond Sam."

Mike says, "In any case, Dr. Williams hasn't gone and submitted any rogue papers to Laser Physics, and if he did, I'm sure he's signed enough IP agreements that Encom would be able to sue him to smithereens, quite aside from Bradley's /explicit/ statement, at the start of the session, that "It's ours"."

Phil says, "If you could publish a new paper on laser theory in < 24 hours then you're the greatest scientist of all time. o_o"

Mike says, "Williams is not that brilliant, and if the Powers That Be thought Williams had a head full of tricksy ideas he'd have been right out on the streets again with nothing but a fat pension, secretarial staf, a fleet of ships, and a couple of slit throats."

Mike says, "well, maybe not that brutal."

Bill [to Phil]: "They aren't the same, no. But if ENCOM doesn't own this laser, for reasons stated above they can make an excellent case that they /should/. The only way to avoid that is to bury it. But that also means the end of our careers in working publically with the technology, yes/"

Phil says, "I guess that depends on what you find."

Phil says, "One thing that will impress Williams is that this laser looks pretty... small."

You say, "So to restate Lou's concerns, either Alan is participating with Sam in pursuing something his father found interesting (and the board will disapprove of spending money on the grounds that they don't like the kid), or he's helping Sam do an end-run around the board (in which case we're expendable technical experts who will be first up against the wall if it comes to light)."

Phil says, "And something we didn't mention explicitly: if you inspect the marks on the floor where the laser was bolted, the apeture was pointed right at the place where the desk was bolted. That's not really safe."

Mike says, "Yes, the size thing was clear from last session. It's far smaller than any G-B apparatus has any right to be.  There's almost certainly some patentable and possibly revolutionary physics right there."

Mike says, "Huh.  Williams will boggle at that, sure enough.  He'll say to himself, "Really?  Maybe Kevin Flynn died because he accidentally tried to teleport the mushy grapefruit on the top of his neck."  Williams is "clever but conventional", so I think it's appropriate that he might /not/ carry that train of logic any further without prompting."

Mike says, "Though... knowing his own limitations in terms of social discourse, I think he will point it out to Lou, and suggest that it might be a subject to delicately broach with Bradley."

You say, "That's fair."

Mike says, "How often, in the published results, did the orange end up getting turned into a tart fragrant mist? ._."

Mike says, "(I'm very much looking forward to the point at which Williams discovers that using the G-B apparatus on living subjects can have results /far/ more interesting than mere disintegration.)"

Phil [to Mike]: "Distressing often in the early days. Not that often at all, at Encom, by the mid-80's, but still with disturbing frequency for other people who tried to duplicate the effort at CERN, Livermore, and MITI."

Phil says, "Like more often than half the time."

Mike says, "So his first reaction is "Jesus Christ I wouldn't want to be sitting there.""

Phil says, "He'd think that it's tickling the dragon's tail, for damn sure."

Mike says, "(on a side note, Williams isn't particularly religious.  He was raised vaguely Christian, hasn't been to church since he moved away from home, hasn't bothered thinking about it since.  "apatheist" is probably apt.)"

You say, "At this rate, the only likely way for these three PCs to get digitized is accident or malice."

Mike says, "Well, that's perfectly in keeping with the canon."

Mike says, "Kevin's first digitization was malice; Sam's, accident."

Phil hmms. "What Mike just said is very true. We don't see anyone digitized with eyes open, so to speak.

Mike says, "(in the sense of "What does this button do? *press*")"

Mike says, "whereas when Williams is confronted with a button he doesn't know what it does, his first instinct is not to just press it."

Phil says, "Well that's why you have Daed."

Mike says, "In Williams' case, it's even worse.  Right now he thinks he /does/ know what the button does, which is "disintegrate you, and maybe put you back together again"."

Mike says, "And the last person /known/ to be experimenting with this apparatus was... never found.  Ominous."

Phil says, "Here's a piece of canon that will fascinate Williams."

Phil says, "Or a piece of my canon."

Mike says, "Okay?"

Phil says, "The weight of Encom's laser was about 37 tons, 642 pounds, two ounces. How much do you think it weighs when you use it to digitize an 8 ounce orange?"

The clock audibly chimes out the hour.

You say, "does it gain 21 ounces when scanning a person? o_o"

Phil says, "... why would you pick 21?"

Phil says, "Is that the alleged weight of the human soul or something?"

You say, "sorry, 21 grams"

You say, "Yes"

Mike says, "I don't know, how much /does/ it weigh?  That sounds like a very important question."

Phil says, "Replicating the G-B experiment for smaller masses, like a microgram of carbon, some experimenters have claimed that the mass of the system remains the same when digitizing an object - or alternately that the mass of the object 'gets lost'. Encom did not try to replicate these results themselves with the big laser on account of not wanting to spend a million dollars to weigh the whole damn thing during firing."

Phil says, "You could easily lose eight ounces to coolant leaks."

Phil says, "As far as Williams knows, it's an open question. But with this much smaller laser you would need a far less precise scale to find out."

Phil says, "Most respectable scientists assume that it's bunk. How could mass disappear? It's preposterous. It would contravene everything we know about thermodynamics."

Mike says, "There'd also be the question of how many joules are consumed by the apparatus, but it'd still be a few dozen orders of magnitude away from 8 oz * c^2."

Mike says, "But the question as to whether or how that correlates with either the mass or the volume of the target object..."

Mike says, "Well, frankly, whatever Bradley has to say is going to crucially shape the next steps of the physical research in any case, but absent more data about known experiments with /this/ apparatus, Williams is going to be doing a lot of very careful analytical experiments which could easily go a month in-game before he even zaps a rat."

You say, "Or a black-ops team will hit the warehouse tomorrow and we'll be in the path of the beam."

Mike says, "The notebooks probably contain enough information to short-circuit the Careful analytical series, though.  If only in the form of cryptic notes about the Grid that make no sense in the context of what is known to muggles."

Mike says, "Bradley himself may not even know more.  Kevin played a lot of stuff close to the vest."

You say, "Yeah. The conversation with Alan will be a very interesting one."
