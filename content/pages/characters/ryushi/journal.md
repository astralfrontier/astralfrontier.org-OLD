Duel
----

Every night, Shao and Ryushi have paired off.  Tonight is no different.  With a campfire flickering about them, each man pairs off with his weapon drawn.  Each adopts their stance, particular to their fighting styles.  For Shao, this is the Northern Dragon's Throne taught by Cathak Surak over three hundred years ago and still taught today.  For Ryushi, this is the Ro stance, named after the Low Realm character whose shape the stance is reminiscent of, taught by Shoubuya and many of the other martial schools of the East.

Since his Exaltation, Ryushi has become a much more capable fighter; nevertheless, he acknowledges the three centuries of mastery that Surak's students and heirs refined and poured into their swordsmanship.  For all his confidence in his new-found Solar status, he acknowledges that Shao is better still.  The Dynast has received a level of training that would have cost Ryushi a princely sum in the city of Nexus, all thanks to his semi-divine heritage and fortunate birth on the Blessed Isle.  He did not even know the name of Cathak Surak until two nights ago, when Shao let it slip during a moment of boasting after their previous training.

The Solar knows as well that this duel is more than a friendly competition between two men of the blade.  He has enough memory of the Terrestrial attitude to realize that Shao is doing what any Prince of the Earth must - asserting his mastery and his dominance over his lessers.  Although he hired bodyguards to escort him into the desert, it would be a grave insult to Dragon-Blooded pride if he could not at least match his hirelings' skill.  And the more there to witness the matches, the better.  This, too, is part of being Prince of the Earth: to demonstrate your undeniable power before those who ought to do you obesiance by your inherited right.

These thoughts take little time.  Ryushi is familiar with abandoning thought in a moment of crisis, only to resume it later.  He discards such thinking effortlessly as Shao begins to rush at him.  The Surak stance is nimble and airy, taking best advantage of the Air Aspect Terrestrial's light nature and mastery of wind.  Ryushi can feel the desert heat blow across his face as the stance draws out the breezes of evening to propel Shao forward, and he feels his arms moving almost mechanically to draw up his blade.  The ring of steel against steel echoes across the sands and ricochets off the cliffs, and Ryushi gives a yard of ground as part of his defensive effort.  Shao grins, pressing the advantage.

The two men duel by firelight.  Shao aggressively charges in, matching the already husky Nexan's bulk with his own and using his superior talent to make up the difference.  For his part, Ryushi parries again and again, diverting Shao's blade this way and that rather than simply meeting it force to force.  More than once the Dragon-Blooded swings too close, and Ryushi's skin is bruised by the passage of steel across it.  Nevertheless neither man wishes to injure the other, particularly in light of the dangers lurking in the jungles around them.  It would not do to injure a comrade who may become necessary to survival only minutes later.

Through the nights of practice combat, and tonight in particular, Ryushi is learning.  In the back of his mind he feels these lessons have been taught before.  He watches Shao's feet and arms move, recognizing the motions like some distant, half-caught memory of childhood.  He studies the patterns of light that sparkle on the Exalt's blade, feeling himself mesmerized in some part by them, and in those times of trancelike recollection he watches himself fight like the very master of the sword.  Other times, he finds himself able to consciously make use of some advanced technique Shao demonstrates in his own style, and both men are surprised when Ryushi manages to easily disarm Shao and cast his blade aside into the sand.  This, however, is an exception to the rule, and in further minutes of the bout Shao re-demonstrates his proficiency.

The practice duel ends with both men collapsing to the sand in exhaustion and drinking of their waterskins until they're drained dry.  "A good match," mumbles Ryushi, mopping sweat from his brow.  Shao chuckles and nods.  "You're getting better," he admits.

Night Meditation
----------------

Night lies over the empty city.  Feeling the call of a distant, half-remembered dream, Ryushi opens his eyes.  In his mind are fleeting images of ancient humanoid reptiles, like those shown on the statue, and elsewhere in the city.  He remembers blood on water as a part of it, but.. no more comes.

Roiling in his mind are memories and feelings, and those he knows with painful certainty are not dream.  They compel him to action - any action - for to simply lie here and endure them cannot be borne.

He thinks of the four dragons tattooed on his back.  The dragon has always symbolized strength and power, and he truly felt that power when gazing at the statue in the Manse.  Now he feels unworthy before the heritage his masters at Shoubuya gave him.  He has power.  How has he chosen to use it?

He is awake, lying more or less on the ground of the inhuman apartment the group found for itself.  The others have made their own arrangements.  The door is barred - a precaution that may not hold up to determined assault, but one that will at least alert those within.  Looking around, he can see little to nothing in the gloom of the room.  Anyone who isn't asleep conceals that fact well, and in any event, Ryushi's not concerned who sees him go.  He would be if they knew his thoughts.

He rises carefully, watchful of the breathing of his comrades.  His mission should not interfere with their rest; that's just natural.  Without any thought, his hand reaches about the scabbard of his blade and slides it through his belt.  He slips on his boots, carefully removes the barriers at the front door, and passes out into the night.  He must make something right.

A panorama of stars lies above him, dancing in their stately fashions.  The Nexus man smiles faintly as he watches, thinking about the fates they spell out for the men who scurry like ants beneath them.  /And where is my star?/ he asks silently of the night sky.  No answer is coming, but the heavenly sparkles continue to smile down in their teasing way.  He begins walking under their glittery blanket of mystery.

The great gates of the city's Manse stand before him.  He has brought only his sword for protection; even his cloak was left behind.  The chill of the desert night will not be too much to bear.  Carefully he kneels before the gates, arranging his feet beneath his legs and adopting the pose of meditation he saw his master use when focusing his mind.  Ryushi has come to learn the value of such moments of introspection.

He relaxes, letting his thoughts wash upon the cliffs of his heart.  One by one he identifies the feelings that drove him to this night meditation.  Envy, at the power of the Manse.  Greed, at the wealth the statue represented.  Frustration, at the inability to master such a simple thing as a Manse.  Annoyance, at Sable's egotism.  Pride, as Sable finally confessed his weakness before Ryushi.

Such low feelings were the lifeblood pumping through the veins of the city of Nexus, and Ryushi is no stranger to them from his time there.  But there are more aristocratic vices he so vaguely remembers from his childhood.  Refined sins that he cannot name fill his heart as well, such as a sort of vanity or entitlement that deluded him into thinking the Manse was his by some nebulous right.

He must show contrition before the Manse itself, and to come to honor it as he properly should.  And, too, he must again master himself before he forgets his place.  Magical power is here for the taking.  He realizes now that he reached out for it too soon, too recklessly.  And he must atone.

He whispers a rough prayer to his distant patron.  The Sun is no longer in the sky, and perhaps it will not listen anyway, but he doesn't care.  His lips move, but no sound comes out.  He need not give voice to the words; everyone with a need to hear them can do so.  In time he finishes it, and continues his meditation.  Slowly he remembers himself again.

An hour of the night passes.  His need for sleep asserts itself, but he resists it, rising.  Now his sword is drawn from its sheath by a steady hand, and he holds it before him.  He begins the swinging exercises he was taught, starting with the simplest - to swing the blade from over one's head and stop at a precise point.  He remembers his training.  He remembers his duty.  The sword reminds him with every downward stroke that his power must be carried so far and no further.

There is beauty here.  He will preserve it.  There is honor in Shao's service, whatever the man thinks of the Solar Exalted.  He will earn it.  There is companionship in drawing Sable out.  He will find it.  There is justice in helping Argent and Shandi.  He will defend them.  That is who he is.

It is an exhausted and satisfied Ryushi that returns to the apartment and settles in to rest again.  The cold night air makes the sweat of his brow prickly and painful, but he welcomes it.  He knows himself again, and he can be proud of himself again.

Yume
----

Ryushi finds himself awakening.  He raises one burly hand to his forehead, mopping it dry of sweat.  He looks around.  The camp is quiet; dawn has not yet come.  "Perhaps..." he thinks to himself, "perhaps I was being punished.  I travel with someone Sable calls inconvenient.  I am a demon to his people.  Should I avoid dealing with him?"

The memory of the ambush comes alive in his mind.  He remembers his miserable performance, the self-doubt he felt in that time, and the fear of revelation.  He could have called Daoyang to him.  Would its power have protected him from the Vexhounds?  Would his own have?

He wonders, too, about their Anathema lord, their maker and jailer.  The creatures seem aware of their own handicap.  They seem to coordinate well to defend themselves, but this itself is not a sign of intelligence.  Many otherwise-dumb creatures on the Bordermarches show uncanny prowess in certain things, he remembers.  They can steal Essence from the Exalted.  Perhaps they were a defense of some kind.  If so, would they steal Essence from another Anathema?

He shakes himself free of these thoughts, and reflects back on his bowmanship.  He has had little practice with the bow, and yet even his poor showing during the ambush reflected an increasing amount of potential.  Has he improved so much in such a short time?  He wonders at the voice that spoke, describing "the will to overcome".  But it's not possible to will oneself to be better at something.  Is it?

Experimentally he reaches for the bow next to his bed, curling his feet under his legs into a relaxed sitting position.  He turns and twists it about, studying it, mindful that nobody is paying attention to him.  He has no wish to excite scorn or suspicion from the others.

The heft is familiar enough.  He has hunted with it before in his travels.  Something is different, though.  In his fingers he feels a faint trembling.  He recognizes this from his swordsmanship - when holding a sword or axe, his hand automatically wishes to adopt a good grip on the haft.  Now he feels the same simple impulses responding to the bow.  He has indeed gotten better, although he can't remember how or when.

Perhaps it's time to try some archery practice.

Sight Without Eyes
------------------

Mindful of the hypnotic stance of the Vexhounds, Ryushi has decided to take the initiative.  Whether or not archery will suffice against the creatures, a fact which the Solar is growing more doubtful of, or whether some other trickery is required, Ryushi has taken to heart the dream of a distant night.  He is relying on his own power.  He awoke with the gift of a Charm in mind.  Now he seeks to master another one through practice and dedication.  Rather than manifesting his control of Essence in the heat of battle or in moments of desperation, he has resolved to teach himself this talent.  He will be the equal of Shao or Sable yet.

With some of the hastily improvised and poorly fletched arrows the group has managed to cobble together, he departs the Manse and environs for the forest.  The arrowheads are nothing more than blunt wooden tips, sufficient for fowling and hunting, and in this case it is not Ryushi's intention to depopulate the woodland.  He seeks to fire his arrows without the distracting motion of the vexhounds interfering with his shot.  Perhaps it is their motion, not just unnatural agility, that make them such formidable targets.

In the forest, Ryushi takes a position on the branch of a tree, and balances himself as steadily as he can.  On the jungle floor, it will be hard to see the creatures he seeks.  But he is here to learn to see them without mundane vision.

He feels about, settling in, starting with his mundane senses.  He watches the leaves of the fecund flora, noting the flutter as the wind brushes them.  He watches, too, as the leaves move without the kiss of the wind, and he feels the presence of the tiny creature that caused it.  He watches with his mind, thinking as the creature thinks, envisioning it scurrying around.  He meditates on it.  He focuses his thoughts, stretching out with his senses both mundane and mystic, feeling for where it might move - must move - next.

Over the course of hours he begins to grow aware of the currents of Essence rippling about beneath the leaves, above the soil.  He is aware enough of the predators and prey of the jungle that he can read their hearts.  He knows that when he fires his arrow, he will break the pattern.  Like a rock hurled through the surface of a pond, he will destroy the delicate forms of Essence that exist here.  He will need to start over again.  But he accepts that.  Readying his bow, he draws the blunt arrow and fires.

Later, Emerging from the wood, Ryushi seems satisfied with his results.  He fired three times today, twice hitting an unseen creature and stunning it.  He can only feel their presence fitfully, but he can at least feel it.  He must learn more, and the magnitude of his ignorance of Essence shames him.  But he discards such doubts.  The fire of victory, even a partial one, also burns in his heart.  He must learn more, but he knows now that he can.

Ryushi looks out from a mighty ocean, with stormclouds thundering overhead.  The water reaches as high as his knees, and under his feet he feels the faintest spur of rock supporting him.  Around him in the sky, the Vexhounds twist and roll.  And from time to time they metamorphose, taking other shapes.  Sometimes they are the dragons whose tattoos adorn his back.  Sometimes they are true dragons, bearing the colors of the elements.  Sometimes they have human faces.  Sometimes they are his own.

In his hands is Daoyang.  It flickers fitfully, and whatever portion of it dips beneath the ocean seems to disappear entirely before resuming its existence once pulled back.  A mocking laughter seems to accompany every burst of thunder from the hate-filled sky.  Beyond that sky, Ryushi can feel another voice calling to him.  He cannot make out the words; he can only listen to its distant rumble.

He lifts Daoyang, gesturing with the sword as though cutting through the clouds.  They duly separate as he pantomimes their cleaving with his blade, and through the gap shines a sparkling ray of sunlight.  It strikes him like fire, but he feels no pain.  Around him the hound-dragons swirl like a daemoniac snake-den.

"Trust Not the Power of the Dragons," the voice of the sky is saying, and Ryushi strains to hear.  He feels a pain in his chest, and looks down, watching the front of his attire disintegrate where the sea-spray touches it.  Looking back up, he listens again.  "Trust your own power," the voice says, and then speaks again.  But Ryushi cannot hear it.  He strains his ears, willing the thunder to cease its rolling.  The dragon-things around him continue their hypnotic knotting.  He watches, feeling himself entranced by the motion.  The voice speaks again.  "The will to overcome is your weapon."
