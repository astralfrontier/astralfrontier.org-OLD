# Sookie

Susannah Perenolde was once a noblewoman of Alterac, a member of one of the ruling families of the region.  She was family to Aiden Perenolde, the notorious traitor, but disagreed strongly with his actions during the Second War.  For her trouble, she was taken away in chains and given over to orcish warlocks of what was to become known as the Twilight's Hammer clan.

Along with other captives, Susannah was forced to take part in a horrific experiment.  The merciless orcs, overseen by the cruel Cho'gall and human cultists recruited later had heard of something called the "curse of flesh" from their studies of the Old Gods of Azeroth.  Through an unholy union of living being and elemental, a new breed of living weapon could be created that would faithfully serve the Twilight's Hammer - beings who could pass for human, bred with the powers of the elements, and as subservient and enslaved as the elementals themselves.

Susannah's tortured flesh would become one more vessel for the blasphemous apotheosis the cult planned.  Many of the children of these experiments perished.  Many more survived, some mad to a greater or lesser degree, many twisted and deformed.

One such child was named Sookie - the diminuitive form of her mother's name - by one of her handlers, an orcish woman who cheerfully accepted the nihilistic bent the cult had taken.  This orc, named Hurragh, taught young Sookie about the cult, about the Old Gods and about their plans for Azeroth.  She attempted to induct the child into the cult of her own free will.

At first things seemed to be going well with the experiment.  Sookie and the other children like her were put through grueling, painful, and often cruel lessons by their masters.  They were shackled, one and all, with elemental bracers of control - just like the elementals and demons conjured to serve the cult.  In time, though, Hurragh's twisted idealism and the cold realities of the Twilight Hammer came into conflict.  Sookie does not speak of it, but one night the orcish woman lost her life while suppressing the enchantments on the girl's bracers, and she ran into the night.
