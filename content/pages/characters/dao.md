# Dao

The man called Dao is a shadow.  His long black hair is braided and hangs down to his waist, in the traditional Chinese fashion.  His face shows the half-caste heritage he was born under; slanted eyes hide behind the rectangular lenses of his blue-tinted glasses, while the rest of his angular features betray the war between centuries-old Frankish and Han genes.  His build is somewhat stocky, and his strength is greater than what his frame suggests.  As with all those of his eldritch heritage, his skin is naturally pale to the point of bloodlessness, although he betrays no other sign of sickness.

When he is undressed, Dao's time in the necro-alchemical vats of Clan Mekhet reveals itself.  Paired rectangular scars decorate his chest and back, revealing where the plastic armor coating that protects his heart from stakes was implanted.  His left forearm has a thin seam on it, and hidden behind the adhesive-sealed flap of skin is a wooden stake that serves him as an emergency weapon.  Similarly, a close inspection would reveal that his pigtail is simply a set of three interwoven garottes made of human hair and weighted on both ends, cunningly affixed at the base of his skull so as to attract no undue notice.  In every sense, his body is a weapon.

Dressed, Dao wears a black shirt and pants in the traditional Chinese fashion.  This is not simply a cultural preference; the loose leggings and short-sleeved shirt have been worn by martial artists and fighters for centuries and they serve the modern hunter equally well.  Over such simple fare, Dao typically wears a heavy leather long-coat with an added inner lining, also black through and through.  The coat is much heavier than others of its type, and no surprise.  Dao has packed a hidden layer with guns, knives, stakes, armor plating, and other essentials of his grisly trade.  At any time, ripping back a velcro patch will expose the next weapon he needs, and many of them can be similarly reached through the various pockets.

Dao uses more than weapons.  His glasses, for example, are more than a fashionable affectation.  The lenses incorporate electronic imaging systems that overlay a thermographic view on his normal sight.  Aside from his unnaturally keen senses, these glasses allow him to track heat sources - such as discharged firearms - and also to notice discrepancies in heat patterns - such as the room-temperature bodies of vampires in a crowd of warm human beings.

Dao is under a curse, laid on him by the Mekhet elders.  As part of the curse, he has no memory as to what he did to earn it.  Whatever its origin, Dao is incapable of knowingly bringing harm to a mortal human being.  While as a vampire hunter this would not trouble him overmuch (the prohibition does not prevent him from slaying ghouls, for example), as a vampire this is a great burden when one considers the usual feeding pattern of the Kindred.  He must subsist on blood gleaned from blood banks, on animals, or other similar sources.  He may freely feed on vampires; it seems that the terms of his curse do not forbid him from taking human blood freely offered.

Aside from the prohibition of blood-taking, part of the terms of his punishment seem to include his role as vampire hunter.  Why he was made into a hunter, and what crime he is atoning for, is not something that crosses Dao's mind frequently.  He has grown to accept his fate.  If he is to kill vampires, and only vampires, then that is how it must be.
