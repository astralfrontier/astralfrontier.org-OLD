# Winston

"I entreat you sir, do not draw that firearm.  I would be obliged to respond in kind.  Allow me to explain myself more thoroughly."

"I am 183 years old, though I don't look a day over 25.  You may call me Winston.  It would be.. troublesome to reveal my family name, for that high society of Great Britain I know as home might question the motives of any gentleman who availed himself of an establishment with a character and reputation such as yours is known to possess."

"I retain my appearance primarily by virtue of an extraordinary gift. By what blessing of God or Nature I know not, I am endowed with a most remarkable regenerative ability.  Wounds close before my very eyes; fatigue does not hinder me as it would a normal man.  I may be killed by overwhelming violence, but by the will of Providence I will withstand any lesser assault."

"Though I was born into the privileged society of England, and occupied the station my breeding warranted to the age of manhood, I became possessed of the knowledge of my singular inheritance of body, and was forced to resolve the matter after an unfortunate remark nearly spurred a duel between myself and another gentleman - and honor has been satisfied, I feel compelled to add.  Aware that such positions could thrust upon me the singularly unpleasant burden of unwanted notoriety, I took it upon myself to depart the blessed home I had known for so long."

"I travelled by steamer to the New World, and settled for a time in the Americas.  It was because of that stay that my skill at firearms is remarkable, and I should like to relate the tale to somebody, at least."

"It is a well-known fact that a man receives only a mild benefit from facts and learning which have no bearing on his situation; that the greatest possible education comes from direct experience.  This has always been my philosophy."

"Thus, in the American West, my education in the revolver began.  I had some training in the use of the weapon and was familiar enough to defend myself as a gentleman ought.  In those cases where my expertise sufficed to prevail over the bandits and riff-raff I encountered, I gained valuable experience.  And of course in those cases where it was believed I had been shot to death... Well, there were no witnesses to report on the startling recovery I made.  I ensured that my secret remained secure.  None would mourn the passing of a train robber, cattle rustler or other villain of such despicable nature."

"Content that I was well-defended, I used the remainder of my financial inheritance to continue the program of travel and education I had mapped out for myself.  As it would not do to remain in a single place long enough for my distinct quality of healing to incite notice, I resolved to travel widely and avail myself of the wonders of the world.  And so it is that I arrive here."
