# The Fractal

The superhero who calls himself "the Fractal" seems, at first glance, to be a costumed vigilante,
the product of intense training and widespread study. Although he can be injured, it never seems
to last - he'll take a beating one night and be ready to fight again the next. Police commissioners
can attest to his ability to disappear from a locked room the moment they look away. He fights with
a dozen different martial arts styles and a variety of low-tech weapons, along with his prodigious
store of knowledge and an uncanny ability to keep up with a fleeing adversary.

The Fractal's secret is that he is, in fact, superhuman. His ability is the duplication of his body
into multiple copies - sometimes dozens at a time. He has a variety of secret identities, from
unassuming college students around the world to beat cops and detectives in a dozen precints. He
is a student, adventurer, athlete, and more in his various incarnations, and when he causes a
duplicate to vanish, from wherever it is, he gains its accumulated expertise and experience.

Psychovore
==========

The Fractal's worst enemy is a lunatic telepath called Psychovore. Once he has a genetic link with
a target - through blood, flesh, or even inheritance - he can read and influence the target's mind,
steal their memories or personality, and more. As long as the genetic material remains fresh,
he can make use of the memories, skills, and minds he consumes.

Psychovore knows the Fractal's secret, but doesn't know where he keeps his "real body" - the one
that would allow Psychovore's powers to work on him. Psychovore's obsession is to acquire the
multiple lifetimes of expertise the Fractal possesses, and to this end he will hurt but not go
so far as to kill the hero. He will gleefully murder the duplicates when possible, but to keep other
villains from beating him to his goal, he refuses to share the hero's secret with anyone - if
only he knows there is a real body, only he can target it.

Psychovore's powers cannot use the Fractal's duplicates as a genetic link - whatever the dupes are
isn't enough to create a bond.

Psychovore's body has a healing factor, common to most super-beings. The villain has replaced many
parts of his body - fingers, patches of skin, and the like - with those of high-value targets of
his telepathy, letting him perpetually tap into their talents. His own mind is a bizarre farrago
of thoughts, images, plans, and motives, and his body is a horrifying jigsaw of skin tones and
stolen body parts.
