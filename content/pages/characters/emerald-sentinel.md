# The Emerald Sentinel

**The Emerald Sentinel (N'ga)**

**High Concept:** Fearless tribal hunter turned superhero  
**Trouble:** Stranger in a strange land  
**Aspects:**

* I must broaden my imagination
* Wielder of the Green Lantern ring
* Your technology means nothing to me

**Approaches:** Careful +3; Clever +1; Flashy +0; Forceful +1; Quick +2; Sneaky +2

**Stunts:**

* Because I can create powerful constructs with my ring, I get a +2 to Forcefully Overcome problems using constructs.
* Because I am constantly learning new things, I get a +2 to Sneakily Create an Advantage when using an unexpected or novel tactic.
* Because I am worthy of being a Green Lantern, once per session I can throw off a mind-affecting or fear-based aspect or condition without making a roll. This does not include Consequences.

**Power Facts:**

* Wielder of a Power Ring, whose potential power is described [here](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Lantern_Ring)
* Constructs are limited by the Sentinel's own imagination and education, and are for the moment very primitive in nature.
* Aside from powers granted by the ring, the Sentinel is a man without fear and may shrug off or otherwise actively resist any attempt to cow him or dominate his mind.
* The Sentinel is a healthy adult human male in excellent physical and mental condition.

**Background:**

When the Guardians of the Universe choose a bearer for their power rings, their qualifications are simple. The wielder must be without fear, and must uphold the principles upon which the Green Lantern Corps was founded. They care nothing for species, creed, or culture. And so it was that a member of the Sentinelese people, one of the last uncontacted tribes on modern Earth, received a Power Ring.

N'ga was a hunter for his people. He knew of the weird alien folk who sometimes came on their metal fish and brought things. His people knew very well that these were bribes and offerings of false friendship, and they wisely rejected them. This is also what N'ga first thought of the green ring that floated down from the sky and into his hand.

But the ring spoke of faraway places and mysterious things. These visions called to the curiosity of the young man and awakened a desire to see the alien world beyond. He would learn everything there was to learn about the world beyond. Could the ring protect and guide him during this journey, he asked? It could. And so he accepted its offer to become someone new and join this mysterious "Green Lantern Corps".

He would explore this "Earth", the strange outer-world beyond the comfortable home he'd always known. He would travel to these exotic destinations, like "Metropolis" or "Coast City", and learn the ways of the aliens who looked like his people. And if danger threatened, he would even protect these weird alien folk called "humans". After all, the ring said, they were also part of the tribe. He learned the name of his home in the aliens' tongue - North Sentinel Island - and used it as the basis for a new name for himself: the Emerald Sentinel.
