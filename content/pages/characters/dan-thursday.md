# Dan Thursday

After his growing psychic awareness of atomic disturbances throughout the solar system sent uneasy thoughts into the telepathic group-consciousness of his people, the alien prince known to Earth as "Dan Thursday" was sent to make contact with the humans and discover the source of this disturbance. Only by discovering the truth and bringing order back to the system will Dan find himself welcomed back to his tribe. 

Dan was trained by the adepts of North Polar Jupiter, learning to focus his atomic sense - awareness of etheric and sub-etheric vibrations - into other psychic abilities. He learned the Jovian fighting arts and practiced daily. He is a tracker, woodsman, and warrior who wields simple weapons and wears little more sophisticated than skins, but he is more capable than he looks. 

The Jovians
-----------

The Jovian people have always kept to themselves. Ever since their tribes evolved the use of telepathy and other psychic powers, they have worked to protect their world from outsiders. Jovians are muscular and physically powerful due to the stresses of life on Jupiter, and their highly evolved psychic powers give them bulging foreheads and an imposing gaze. 

For the most part, the Jovians live in harmony with their natural environment. They hunt the flying bison and cultivate living things they need to survive. Their mastery of mental powers freed them from the drive to conquer the world through technology, like humans, though they have some conceptual understanding of vibration and radiation. 

Some Jovians are gifted with an "atomic sense" - a psychic awareness of etheric and sub-etheric vibrations. Long ago, a group of such gifted individuals traveled north and established a school. Becoming the adepts of North Polar Jupiter, they studied psychic power and combat in all its forms. They developed a physical and mental combat style inspired by their race's strengths - the mind and body in balance. Their atomic sense led them to unlock the secrets of the thorium crystals which grew in abundance on Jupiter, and to harness them as weapons and tools. 

The Jovians blanket their entire planet in a mental cloaking field which hides their existence, a phenomenon they refer to as the "Endless Illusion". Thus, they have escaped the notice of aliens such as the Xirians. However, the Endless Illusion is only possible if the group-mind of the race is balanced and harmonious. For this reason, they exile disruptive influences from the planet, rather than endanger the entire race. 

The Jovians as a race are too insular to be spacefarers, but some have mastered teleportation. With the aid of sophisticated psychic gates, costly to operate in both thorium reserves and mental energy, they are able to traverse interplanetary space. A few explorers and exiles are periodically sent through the gates. Not all return.
