This spell enhances the caster's intellect and mental focus, allowing him to use two or more spells in conjunction with each other. For example, a skilled wizard could cast Silent Image, Ghost Sound, and Mage Hand and slave them together to create the illusion of a person lifting and moving up to 5 pounds of weight.

The caster must first cast Spellslave, declaring two spells (plus another every 4 caster levels) that will be joined together. He then casts the spells themselves. Spellslave takes effect upon the last spell of the group being cast, and its duration is the shortest duration among all the linked spells.

The caster must control the slaved spells as a whole, not individually. In the example above, if he is using Mage Hand to move an object, the Silent Image must also be seen to do so. However, a single concentration action is sufficient to maintain all the slaved spells.

Example Spellslave combinations:

* Mage Hand + Ghost Sound + Silent Image to create the illusion of a humanoid figure who can hold or manipulate small objects.
* Detect Magic + Silent Image to highlight and describe the magical properties of something in the mage's field of vision.
* Detect Secret Doors + Unseen Servant to automatically open any secret passages the mage sees.
