# Stupid Wizard Tricks

False Focus
-----------

The [False Focus] feat says "you can cast any spell with a material component costing the value of a divine focus or less without needing that component."

* Since most materials ("a tuft of wool", etc.) are expected to cost less than 100 g or so, this effectively means that most spells don't have a material component.
* Several powerful spells, including permanent-duration spells like [Continual Flame], can be made for free.
* Ultimate Equipment p. 66 has a holy symbol tattoo

The following spells can effectively be cast for free with a 100 g focus:
[Acid Pit],
[Acidic Spray],
[Animate Dead] (up to 4 HD),
[Arcane Lock],
[Conjure Black Pudding],
[Continual Flame],
[Create Treasure Map],
[Create Undead] (up to 2 HD),
[Detonate],
[Fabricate Bullets],
[Fire Trap],
[Illusory Script],
[Magic Mouth],
[Nondetection],
[Phantom Trap],
[Possess Object],
[Programmed Image],
[Project Image],
[Sentry Skull],
[Stoneskin, Communal] (up to one person),
[Treasure Stitching],
[Wall of Iron]

#### False Focus - Specific Spells

* [Animate Dead], [Create Undead] - for neutral or evil wizards, this is a cheap way to build up some muscle.
* [Continual Flame] - spend a day, set up your whole party.
* [Create Treasure Map] - suddenly this becomes affordable for characters at low levels.
* [Fire Trap] - cheap, low-powered explosions triggered by opening rather than reading.
* [Illusory Script] - time-shift your *Suggestion* spells at no cost.
* [Stoneskin] - normally 250 gp, but the Communal variant is only 100 gp per creature. If you cast it only on yourself, you can do so at no cost.
* [Treasure Stitching] - normally this is expensive, and lasts only a day per level (9 days minimum for a wizard casting 5th level spells). But like Shrink Item, if you can cast this at no cost, you can use it to set up things like 10-foot cubes of solid stone and re-use them later as traps for battlefield control.

Long-Duration Spells
--------------------

The following spells have days-long durations, are permanent, or are cast instantly with a lasting effect.
