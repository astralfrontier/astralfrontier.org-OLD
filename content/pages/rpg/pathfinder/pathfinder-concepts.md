# Pathfinder Concepts

**Alchemist**: Elf from the Mana Wastes. Concept: ex-wizard turned Mad Bomber.

> "I woke up in the Mana Wastes. I had the burned fragments of a spellbook and little else. I'm sure I used to know magic... But also I knew alchemy, and the people who found me were kind. I wanted to repay them."

> "Sure, I was a little unstable for awhile, but I'm much better now. The old scholar Deen said I must have teleported into the Mana Wastes with some sort of mental magic cast on me, and it scrambled my brain. Nothing a few elixirs can't..."

> "... Hey, do you hear that? Kobolds? No, not again, it's my vulture, you can't have it! Get BACK you fiends! Ignore me, huh? Well I'll SHOW you what alchemy can do! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!"

**Barbarian**: Half-Orc greatsword wielder. Concept: animalistic berserker mercenary.

Special request: the character is a savage half-man, half-beast from the Mwangi Expanse rather than a true half-orc, although the stats are identical.

> "Ten men came to the jungle, looking for wealth. Nine died. One crippled. Can't be warrior, but can still teach. He taught my tribe letters and tactics. Strength enough to hold back other tribes. And he taught me this sword. Many stories of the outside. Now I see it for myself, and I bring back outside wealth to the tribe."

**Bard**: Elf archer. Concept: embedded journalist/USO entertainer turned deserter. Inspired by Phil Davis from "White Christmas".

> "I hail from Molthune. I was an entertainer for the troops for a time, until the war started in earnest. I became an embedded scribe - taking reports for the crown about the state of the war, reading and writing dispatches for my captain. My unit was wiped out, and I... I deserted. But I honor them by telling the stories of their bravery to anyone who will listen."

**Cavalier**: Human (Varisian) from Lastwall. Concept: Professional soldier running from a hidden disgrace. Inspired by Mal Reynolds (Firefly) and Valiar Marcus (Codex Alera).

> "Don't ask me about myself and I'll do the same for you. If your gold is as good as your word, you've got my sword. If not, you've got problems."

**Cleric**: Aasimar Cleric of Sarenrae, Merciful Healer archetype. Concept: ex-slave combat medic. No direct inspiration.

> "I was a slave to the House of Thrune in Cheliax since my birth. It fell to me to minister to the gladiators and other warrior-slaves who fought for the amusement of the nobles in time of peace, and to the soldiers who fought for the empire."

> "Sarenrae smiled on me from the infinite sky. I escaped my captors and sought to make my way where she guides me. I still wear my chains, for I know that they are meaningless to a truly free spirit."

**Druid**: Human (Garundi). Concept: Warrior-philosopher in harmony with both man and nature. Inspired by Optimus Primal.

> "The Fangwood was fierce fighting, always. And we stayed, and fought, until that night.. My tribe, my Garundi kin, all turned by that black sorcery the Darkblight. The army came, and did its best to contain the corruption. Crystalhurst lost a lot of good people. I repaid them by becoming one of them, for a time."

> "Now, though, I can't say that I agree with Nirmathan ideals. They prune the branches without uprooting the tree, and call it justice. Now I look for help elsewhere."

**Inquisitor**: Half-Orc follower of Gorum. Concept: Itinerant drill sergeant.

> "The Lord in Iron gives us strength in battle. There is honor in warfare, and glory in victory. Deserters who forsake their armies, monstrous creatures who threaten the innocent rather than standing for themselves on the field of battle, and a knife in the back rather than good honest steel - all these are hated by Gorum. And Gorum's enemies are my enemies."

**Monk**: Human (Tian). Concept: Righteous hero on the path of vengeance. Inspired in general by Shaw Brothers movies.

> "The men in red who murdered my father and bride at our wedding are here in this land. I will find them and revenge myself upon them. And then I will retire to the temple, to atone and to contemplate my sins."

**Paladin**: Human (Taldan). Concept: Faithful but weak priest exalted as divine champion. Inspired by Captain America.

> "The Test of the Starstone is too much. Too much power, for godhood is a far remove from mortality. Too much risk, for many bold and capable souls are lost attempting it, and those who deserve it most seek it least."

> "I was the most devout of Iomedae's followers. When they told me that the Star Elixir would help me serve my god more fully, I didn't hesitate. And when my frail frame gave way to this powerful body, blessed by divine power to challenge evil, I put away my books and scrolls and days in the garden. I took up the sword. But.. there are days, I admit, when I miss my garden."

**Ranger**: Half-Elven (Ulfen) from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Concept: Raider's son torn between gentleness and savagery.

> "I learned the bow and the blade from my father. From my elvish mother, I don't know. My father would never raid her village while he lived, and told his fellows likewise.  He spoke of a gentle angel who lived there, with warmth unknown to the Ulfen."

> "When his rival mockingly presented me as an infant to my father, my face still wet with my mother's blood, my father slew the man then and there. And in time, my father fell too. I have no revenge and no family, nothing but bow and blade. So... will I be like my father, or will I be like that which he sought to protect?"

**Rogue**: Human (Vudrani) from Jalmeray. Concept: Betrayed courier-spy.

> "Consider the knife. A sharp edge, a thing not often found in nature. Easily overlooked, easily transported, easily used. Held or thrown, cooking tool or weapon. And expendable."

> "My lord sent me to a rival nobleman's household as an infiltrator at a young age. I fed information back to my household despite the danger to my life, for as a bastard child I had no other home. Then I was outed, and nearly killed, and I learned just whose inconvenient bastard I'd really been. Efficient."

> "I have no home, but I still have my skills. And I'm hungry."

**Sorcerer**: Human (Chelaxian) with Draconic Heritage. Concept: Draconic byblow.

> "I will not be intimidated, frightened, pushed around, or bought off. I have had enough of being someone's toy. Walk away, or you'll regret it."

**Summoner**: Half-Elf with Dragon companion. Concept: Young knight-errant.

> "My people returned from Sovyrian with strange allies. Now I conjure them across the gulfs of space and time. But more than that - I am joined by a great elvish hero of the past, who still seeks his own Brightness in another form. Together we will find it!"

**Witch**: Tiefling with prehensile tail and bat familiar. Concept: Urbane, decadent devilspawn. Inspired by Oscar Wilde and Kamen Rider Kiva.

> "House Charthagnion? Lovely people, but my parents are proof that you should never mix business with pleasure. Now, how can we help each other, darling?"

**Wizard**: Elf. Concept: Self-sacrificing and compassionate young mage. Inspired by Negi Springfield.

> "Father used to say that a true wizard had to hold himself apart from his people, but never forget that he was meant to serve them. Father said... a lot of things."

> "We lived near Isger, Mother and Father and I. There was a village nearby. We'd visit them, and Father would work magic on their behalf. Only one day, Father disappeared. He left notes behind, saying he'd discovered something incredible in Nex, and that he'd be back soon. He didn't. The Hellknights..."

> "Anyway, that's old news! What can I do for you today?"
