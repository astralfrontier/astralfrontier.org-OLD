Magical Murder Mystery
----------------------

Reading October Daye stories. Random thought: why not write a mystery not around death, but birth or resurrection? This can take two forms.

1. The robot detective on a world of robots, thinking humans are a myth or historical detail, is asked to investigate an infant human. Where could it have come from?

2. Long ago, a hero died to contain a great evil. The hero is inexplicably back to life - which means the evil is loose too. A mystically-aware investigator must find out how this came about, and perhaps re-seal the evil in the process.

Vessels
-------

I've been dinking with variants on the "Dogs in the Vineyard" concept - people going town to town confronting moral dilemmas. I.ve got one which I THINK allows some unique characters while still prevents superpowered PCs from running roughshod over mundanes

The player characters are *Vessels* - imbued with the divine power of kings and gods. The problem is that this power flows into them from something external. The kingdom built cairns and towers around the land to concentrate this divine force, and tied it to the administrative and governmental structure of the region. In other words, your magic powers derive quite literally from the local ruler's mandate, or lack thereof.

Not just the ruler either. The common people also can influence this flow of power. Since the Vessels were intended as defenders of humanity, this is a built-in failsafe. A Vessel who loses the trust of the people loses his or her power.

So what's the catch? If the town turns against you - be it open rebellion against the king, or a con man convinces a bunch of people that you're here to pillage and rape - the power departs, or may even turn against you. Some Vessels might actually kill themselves trying to use their powers against angry townies.

So on the frontier, there's motivation to act in secret, to conceal your status as Vessel and just go about figuring out what the status is. The more solid your mandate, the more openly you can act.

The other thing is that each Vessel channels that power in ways unique to them. Sympathetic and gentle characters get healing and shielding. Angry warriors get destruction. No two Vessel abilities are strictly alike.

Shadowrun + Batman Beyond
-------------------------

Welcome to the Neo-Gotham of 2039, Shadowrunners! You're not big-time enough to merit the Justice League's attention, so corporate security forces and the occasional mercenary are your biggest worry - with the police under Commissioner Gordon a close second, to be fair. And you've been hearing stories of this new guy, with a bat on his chest.

Your latest employer is a bit sketchy. Your decker isn.t sure who this guy works for, and you need more details than "springing a group of associates from a high-security government facility". Most suits are fine with the generic "Mr. Johnson". He prefers the shorter "Mr. J" for some reason.

World of Warcraft: the Visual Novel
-----------------------------------

Talking to my roommate about X-Com's FPS and its reaction from hardcore RTS fans, I likened it to WoW players encountering "World of Warcraft: the Visual Novel".

Thrall returns to his hometown of Orgrimmar and encounters a variety of girls: unlucky childhood friend Taretha, tsundere shamaness Aggra, bookish Jaina, cunning Sylvanas, and mysterious Garona. Will his relationship with these girls change the direction of his life?
