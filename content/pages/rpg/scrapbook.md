Magical Murder Mystery
----------------------

Reading October Daye stories. Random thought: why not write a mystery not around death, but birth or resurrection? This can take two forms.

1. The robot detective on a world of robots, thinking humans are a myth or historical detail, is asked to investigate an infant human. Where could it have come from?

2. Long ago, a hero died to contain a great evil. The hero is inexplicably back to life - which means the evil is loose too. A mystically-aware investigator must find out how this came about, and perhaps re-seal the evil in the process.

Shadowrun + Batman Beyond
-------------------------

Welcome to the Neo-Gotham of 2039, Shadowrunners! You're not big-time enough to merit the Justice League's attention, so corporate security forces and the occasional mercenary are your biggest worry - with the police under Commissioner Gordon a close second, to be fair. And you've been hearing stories of this new guy, with a bat on his chest.

Your latest employer is a bit sketchy. Your decker isn.t sure who this guy works for, and you need more details than "springing a group of associates from a high-security government facility". Most suits are fine with the generic "Mr. Johnson". He prefers the shorter "Mr. J" for some reason.

World of Warcraft: the Visual Novel
-----------------------------------

Talking to my roommate about X-Com's FPS and its reaction from hardcore RTS fans, I likened it to WoW players encountering "World of Warcraft: the Visual Novel".

Thrall returns to his hometown of Orgrimmar and encounters a variety of girls: unlucky childhood friend Taretha, tsundere shamaness Aggra, bookish Jaina, cunning Sylvanas, and mysterious Garona. Will his relationship with these girls change the direction of his life?
