# Roleplaying

![D20](/attachments/art/200px-D20pic.svg.png){: align="right" class="show-for-medium-up"}

I'm a fan of roleplaying games and RP in general. This includes classic tabletop (D&D-style games), newer narrativist-style games (Fate), and free-form online RP.

I'm a contributor on the Google Plus Fate Core community and [Station 53], and have written the following things of interest:

* *Avengers Accelerated [Part 1], [Part 2], [Part 3], [Part 4], [Part 5]*, illustrating how to model cinematic superheroes using FAE rules as written.
* [Avengers FAE Characters], including stunts, for the above series.
* The first draft of [The Strange] on TVTropes.
* [Roleplaying Resources] and [Roleplaying Scrapbook], most of which will be moved around soon.

### My Games

I'm playing [Legends of New Troy], using FAE. My PC is [Link]. I also have a side-story blog here: [Snow in New Troy](http://snowinnewtroy.blogspot.com/)

I'm running [Wayward Stars], aka World War Xee and set in the same universe, also using FAE.

I'm working on a new game tentatively called [In Thy Name](/rpg/inthyname).

### Game Wishlist

I'd like to try out *The Strange*, *D&D 5th Edition*, *Pathfinder*, *Golden Sky Stories* (or a game very much like it), and many of the Fate or FAE settings out there such as Tianxia.

I've written stuff for [Pathfinder] based on a game that never took off.

### Fate

* [Fate] - New rules, resources, and links for the Fate roleplaying rules.
* [Create Advantage as Combo Builder]

### Game Logs

These are logs of games I ran online.

[FUTILE OCTAVE] - A CthulhuTech campaign, intending to stay true to the original feel of Lovecraft's writing.

[Junkyard Heroes] - A game about blue-collar superheroes, run in GURPS.
