I'm a fan of roleplaying games and RP in general. This includes:

* Classic tabletop (D&D-style games)
* Newer narrativist-style games (Fate)
* Free-form online RP

I play and run Fate, GURPS, and other games. I'm not interested
in Dungeons & Dragons as a system, though Pathfinder seems to
have helped fix most of the issues I dislike about D20.

I'm running one game (_Tenorvale_) and possibly playing in one
more that hasn't started.
