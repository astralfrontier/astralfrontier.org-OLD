# The Mists

The world isn't that far removed from chaos and oblivion.

Over time, a system of nobility has evolved. The kings of the land, along with their rulers, are responsible for holding the shape of the land in their minds. Without this, everything unravels back into unshaped noise.

The high king of all the land has to know everything. Lesser pockets of reality can be held stable by lesser men. What makes a king a king then? A willingness to take the burden. In response his word becomes law, because he is literally standing between them and dissolution.

What is the value of war? War is bloody attrition against reality-holders, threatening the integrity of places. Win enough war and you can literally imagine a territory away from someone else and under your control.
