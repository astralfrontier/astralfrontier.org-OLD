# Human Apocalypse

How about a game where you have a small but resourceful group of intelligent zombies, trying to stay undead in a world overrun by living people who want nothing better than to shoot them in the head? They have to lay low, stay stealthy, gather supplies, and bicker with each other about how best to make it through this disaster.
