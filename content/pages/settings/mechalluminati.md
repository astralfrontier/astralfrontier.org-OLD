# Mechalluminati

Grade-school children pull plastic spheres from their belts on the playground. Facing each other, one shouts "gnomes of Zurich, I choose you!" The other reveals his trump card: "Prieure de Sion, I choose you!" The battle is on as conspiracy-mon struggle on behalf of their human partners.

As these kids get older, though, they learn that their battles had a darker purpose. They are recruited into a counter-conspiracy. To defeat the Reptoids and the Black Helicopters, the teenage heroes will need to make a bio-psychic link with the "Ascended Masters" - sixty-foot-tall cybernetic lifeforms that can be piloted. With their Ascended Masters, the new pilots will battle the sinister forces that truly control the Earth.

The enemy will fight back, of course. Fluoridation in the water and chemtrails will be used to try and break the biological link; the right herbal supplements, sold by reputable online vendors, can resist this insidious attack. And when the heroes are not in their Ascended Masters, theyâ€™ll need survival gear to fight off the hordes of alien mind-controlled slaves.

Can they save the Earth? Or will they disappear forever?

Their vengeful spirits are now inhabiting the bodies of young children, and influencing their parents to take their new hosts into the dangerous world of beauty pageants. Strapping on their night-vision goggles, the PCs have to sneak into the underground Illuminati vaults where the murder victims are buried and sanctify their bodies, then exorcise their spirits from the innocent kids.
