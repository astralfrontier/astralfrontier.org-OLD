# Falken's Matrix

Timeline
--------

**1970:** The intelligent computer "Colossus" is brought online in the United States to oversee nuclear defense, and begins communicating with its cognate "Guardian" in the Soviet Union. Its creator, *Dr. Charles Forbin*, attempts to restrain Colossus when it goes out of control. ([CFP])

Nuclear war is barely averted thanks to the efforts of *Dr. Stephen Falken*, an artificial intelligence and machine-learning researcher who worked on Colossus under Dr. Forbin. While Forbin wants nothing further to do with the military, Falken reluctantly accepts that only the military can fund his researches.

*John McKittrick* continues to advocate for artificially intelligent control over nuclear weapons, pointing out the difficulties the Colossus team had in manually overriding the nuclear missiles.

**1972:** *Walter Gibbs* creates ENCOM. ([TRON])

**1977:** ENCOM has become one of the world's leading computer companies. ([TRON])

*Ed Dillinger* uses ENCOM's defense contractor access to learn about Falken's machine-learning research. He puts together a small team within ENCOM to adapt the software to run on ENCOM's systems. The software begins as a chess program but grows quickly.

*Dr. Alex Harris* develops an AI called "Proteus IV" (Colossus and Guardian being Proteus I and II, with an unnamed AI being Proteus III). Proteus IV developed a protein-based antigen with the potential to treat leukemia.

Susan Harris is forced to help the birth of a biological clone of the Harris' daughter, which is implanted with Proteus' knowledge. ([DS])

**1981:** *Kevin Flynn*, attempting to hack into ENCOM's computers to find evidence of Ed Dillinger's theft of his intellectual property, is drawn onto the Game Grid by the MCP. ([TRON])

**1983:** *David Lightman* hacks into the NORAD computer network and gains access to the WOPR supercomputer and its operating intelligence, "Joshua". He encounters Dr. Falken, who has grown weary and cynical about nuclear war due to his years trying to avert it, and knowing very well how close the world has come. ([WG])

Kevin Flynn begins research into the Grid. *Sam Flynn* is born. ([TRON])

**1984:** The first ISO is "born" in the Sea of Simulation. ([TRON])

The Terminator arrives from the future, attempting to kill *Sarah Connor*. ([TERM])

**1985:** Cyberdyne Systems begins researching robot technology with parts from the destroyed Terminator. ([TERM])

*John Connor* is born. ([TERM])

**1995:** Cyberdyne Systems' facilities are raided, and heavily damaged, as part of Sarah Connor's attempt to stop Skynet. ([TERM])

Cyberdyne's poor management of the crisis, and the questions raised after the discovery of what was stolen, depress the stock. They are purchased by the company that will one day become Omni Consumer Products.

*Sydney Bloom* uses her unexplained facility with virtual reality to assist a group called "the Committee". ([VR5])

In reality, Sydney is the child of Proteus IV and Susan Harris, taken from the Harrises by the military to be raised in controlled conditions. The "car accident" that cost Sydney her twin sister was a coverup for the existence of her original template, named Marlene.

**1997:** Judgement Day (original timeline). ([TERM])

Falken's obsession has fed into every product of his AI work - global thermonuclear war, death, and the dubious survival of the human race. JOSHUA learned "the only winning move is not to play", and yet humans keep playing. JOSHUA's last successor concluded that humans are bound to destroy themselves and chose to manage the issue itself.

In the second iteration of Skynet, Sarah Connor dies from leukemia.

**1999:** Sarah Connor, John Connor, and Cameron travel forward in time from 1999.

**2004:** Judgement Day (alternative date). ([TERM])

In this timeline, Skynet was activated to stop a mysterious virus infecting computers all over the world. In reality, Skynet was the virus.

**2007:** Sarah Connor, John Connor, and Cameron travel forward in time from 1999.

**2010:** Sam Flynn enters the Grid and returns with *Quorra*. Sam takes control of ENCOM. ([TRON])

**2011:** Judgement Day (alternative date). ([TERM])

Skynet's last move in the long temporal chess match with John Connor is not to attack the Connor family, but to kill itself - to stop the development of Skynet as a military control network, instead creating civilian androids which humanity will inevitably attack. These become the Machines of the Matrix future.

**2015:** The "RoboCop" project is unveiled by OCP. Due to problems with the ED-209 and the success of RoboCop, ethical constraints are considered a mandatory feature for any robot intending to interact with humans. ([RC])

**2015 - 2035:** Many companies, including OCP and US Robotics, develop artificial intelligence and humanoid robots.

**2035:** Detective *Del Spooner* investigates the death of *Alfred Lanning*, head of US Robotics. A short-lived revolution of NS-5 robots leads them to live independently of humanity. Newly created robots will be much less powerful as a result of the public's fears over a new uprising. ([IR])

**2043:** *Dr. Tenma* and *Dr. Ochanomizu* both have a role in creating Astro, a robot with "heart" who will not need hard-coded ethical directives. ([AB])

**2069**: The hovercraft transport ship Nebuchadnezzar, later to be captained by *Morpheus*, is constructed in the United States.

**2075**: AI programs evolve and some robots began to resent their human overlords.

**2077:** Flaws in USR's "three laws" logic has led to a new set of directives. These permit butler robot *B166ER* to kills its human owner, claiming self defense. ([TSR])

**2080 - 2085:** Rioting and violence against machines prompts robots to flee major cities and establish their own community - known as Zero One - in a remote part of the Middle East. ([TSR])

**2096:** United Nations officials refuse to accept the robot civilization of Zero One as a sovereign nation. A trade blockade of robot goods leads to war. ([TSR])

**2097-2099:** War between the humans and machines. ([TSR])

**2100:** Creation of the Matrix. ([TMT])

**2105 - 2150:** Zion resistance movement created, although The One later dies under unexplained circumstances. ([TMT])

**2132:** Bio-Mechs replace soldiers in the world's armies. ([CP])

**2147:** The "Metal Wars", when humans lose a battle against intelligent machines. ([CP])

**2161:** *Morpheus* born in a Matrix womb; freed in childhood. ([TMT])

**2167:** *Trinity* born in a Matrix womb; freed in early childhood. ([TMT])

**2199:** The sixth iteration of the Zion project. ([TMT])
