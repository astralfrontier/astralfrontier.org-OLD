# Chosenger

Five young people are about to join the world of fantastic magic and save the Three Earths - past, present, and future - from the machinations of the Onimecha and their leader, Deluge. These five brave heroes, given the bracelets of their Magical Materials, socket their Heartstones to become superpowerful fighters for justice - Chosenger!

They are:

* ChosenRed - the fiery power of the sun
* ChosenWhite - the ever-changing power of the moon
* ChosenViolet - the mysterious power of the stars
* ChosenGreen - the five elements of the natural world
* ChosenBlack - the hidden powers of the abyss

When the Onimecha appear, Chosenger must summon their Warstriders and do battle against these invaders.
