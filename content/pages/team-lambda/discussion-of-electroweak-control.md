# Discussion of Electroweak Control

Phil says, "Someone would have thought to ask him if he could localize a magnetic field enough to acheive magnetic confinement fusion."

Phil says, "MRI machines - which have magnets powerful enough to vibrate water molecules in your body - operate in the range of 1-5 Teslas (the unit of magentic flux density."

Bill says, "he can operate on scales down to an inch or so reliably."

Phil says, "I do not know specifically, but I suppose that true magnetic confinment fusion would require a magnetic flux orders of magnitude higher."

Phil says, "So he can make it small enough. Can he get the intensity? Because the dark side of this is, he could drop bombs on places using nothing more than grenades full of lithium deuteride pellets."

Bill says, "I don't know for sure that he could or couldn't."

Bill says, "But it's thematically appropriate for supers to be able to fusion bomb cities if they're big and bad enough, so I'd say 'probably if he tried'"

Bill says, "And this is the part where a million dollars of lab equipment can be replaced by one Tennessee tweaker - who if he's at all smart or greedy will say 'well why not pay me the million', then go off and spend it on hookers and blow."

Bill says, "And it's difficult to get people like the NSF to agree to those kinds of deals, which is one reason why scientists are frustrated that progress isn't faster despite having demigods on tap."

Phil wonders if The Lovecraft Quote is appropriate here.

Bill says, "hmm?"

Phil says, "'The sciences, all straining in their separate directions, have so far hurt us little' etc."

Bill says, "ah yes."

Bill says, "I need to make a note in the science article about that. There's an abnormally high rate of people who drop out of studying super-biology, mainly because it makes them feel like graduate students working at Area 51."

Phil says, "In your world, Bob Lazar wasn't just a crazy."

Bill says, "it's possible. many people believe that aliens meddled with human biology."

Bill says, "the existence of super-animals (yes, really) does tend to shoot down certain conspiracy theories, while raising others."

Mike says, "Are super-animals superintelligent, or are they just really tough and able to do strange and surprising things?"

Bill says, "depends on the mutation.  and to be fair, we're still debating the actual intelligence of creatures like dolphins and gorillas in the real world.  Nobody has found any demonstrably human-level intelligence in animals - but one could also argue that smart animals would avoid capture and detection."

Bill says, "so - among those creatures that HAVE been observed, it tends to be the same as for humans.  Powers that would have arisen in response to trauma, and that help the animal's survival."

Bill says, "deer who can bend light around their bodies, for example."

Bill says, "the TCC now has codes for manipulation of the fundamental forces, including categories for observed use of the electroweak force.  Though I'm baffled as to the applications a super would have for that."

Geoff says, "Size reduction."

Bill says, "(and I'm not convinced anyone HAS that power, and that scientists didn't just add it to be pedantic)"

Bill [to Geoff]: "interesting point. got any elaboration?"

Geoff says, "Professor Mike has a super in his game whose power is weak force manipulation.  She can alter the internal space of her atomic structure, allowing her to become smaller (but keeping the same density).  She also has a limited ability to alter it in other things, which basically causes small and hideously dangerous radiation releases, as canceling it causes the release of the various particles, especially beta radiation."

Bill says, "Yeah, beta decay is a big deal for these guys"

Geoff says, "It's a core problem issue for the electroweak force.  Cancel or alter that and you get free electrons and possibly some positrons running about.  Theoretically, you might be able to do some serious weirdness with the weak interations and cause some forms of down-transmutation, including turning lead into gold at the cost of ow ow ow beta irradiation ow."

Phil says, "Down-transmutation. o\_o Cool."

Geoff says, "Well, if you're causing weak force decay then you're releasing particles due to boson and quark manipulation, so you can't go up."

Geoff says, "...is down-transmutation actually a term?  I was casting about for a description and that seemed a quick way to describe it."

Mike says, "Right.  Going up requires adding leptons to the nucleus."

Mike [to Geoff]: "Practical transmutation is sufficiently sci-fi that you're allowed to make up your own jargon."

Geoff is a believer that technobabble should be at least semi-comprehensible.  Playing a mad scientist for years made me do that.  Like explaining how I stopped teleportation with a 'sub-dimensional static generator that caused the associated nearby subspace areas to be harder to traverse.'.

Mike says, "To do up-transmutation, you pretty much need to be able to fiddle with the strong force, and probably the electromagnetic force.  It probably helps if you've got hydrogen and/or helium gas floating around the substance - and you're basically inducing fusion."

Mike says, "It's just that, above atomic number 26, fusion is endothermic (and drastically so)."

Geoff says, "Which means having a way to also deal with the energy release."

Mike says, "If you want to transmute up through 26, you have to deal with energy release.  Iron and above, fusion /requires/ energy, which is why elements above iron are only created naturally in supernovas."

Geoff says, "(In supers terms, endothermic reactions are just another form of 'energy release', which is silly, but.)"

Mike says, "So if you want, for example, to turn /tin/ into gold, you need a source of extra leptons to jam into the nucleus, and you also need tons of energy.  Come to think of it, it's hydrogen gas you want (assuming you can induce fusion) - you can fuse hydrogen into helium to gain energy and use the extra energy to jam protons into the tin nucleus."

Phil says, "You still wouldn't want to stand too close to it. o\_o"

Geoff says, "The point is that, relatively speaking, a down-transmute is simpler than an up-transmute, but you still would prefer to do it at a distance."

Mike says, "Hell no.  But a super who can induce fusion had better be able to deal with high energy nuclear radiation anyway."

Mike says, "And yes, the same with a super who can induce radioactive decay."

Mike says, "I'm reminded of the elder Stark fiddling with the Red Skull's energy cells."

Geoff says, "I'm waiting for them to reveal that thing is actually, say, a star in a tesseract."

Phil . o O ( Euclidian dice would not avail in any case. )

Bill says, "The rule for this setting is that while the science must work, you're under no obligation to explain how you got your hands on that science."

Bill says, "And the science must work for two reasons. 1. everyone's powers have some weak spot, vulnerability, or limitation that you can eventually exploit, and 2. powers without science are magic, which is out of theme."
