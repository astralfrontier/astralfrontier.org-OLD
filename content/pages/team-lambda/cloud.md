# Cloud

Cloud is a member of [Team Lambda].

Cloud is an African-American male, standing about 6'2". He has a deep black complexion and shoulder-length dreadlocks. He normally wears a thick leather duster, with pockets and pouches stuffed with glass vials containing various liquids or gases, and light body armor beneath it.

Position
--------

Cloud is an offense specialist, who uses his powers to create traps, attack from surprise, and launch nearly undetectable missiles with varying degrees of lethality. He is capable of using his powers to create concealment for himself. He relies on misdirection and concealment for protection, rather than armor or toughness.

Personality

Powers
------

Cloud's entire body is super-charged with electricity, and is capable of generating its own power through an unspecified mechanism. He does not need to eat or drink, and he has a moderate regenerative capability.

The cells of Cloud's body broadcast on radio wavelengths. He is capable of controlling this broadcast, or receiving it, even when the cells are separated from the rest of his body (for example, in a drop of blood).

Cloud can somehow use this energy to control the expansion, contraction, and temperature of liquids, gasses and plasmas, or transition from one state to another. Some of his cells must be in contact with the matter to be affected.

His powers have been used for the following things, among other applications:

* The creation of explosive traps (based on steam or gasoline), by leaving a drop of his blood in the medium and triggering it remotely.
* Throwable gasoline bombs, or bombs using other chemicals.
* Creating clouds of steam around himself to obscure vision, or to scald a target.
* Manipulating water vapor in the air to create fog.
* Causing heat exhaustion in a target by rapidly raising the temperature of the surrounding air.
* Creating a flamethrower or flame jet by super-heating nearby air.
* Moving his own body at high speeds, including a limited form of flight, by creating artificial low- and high-pressure areas in the nearby air.

He uses blowgun darts as his primary weapon, coated with blood from pricking his tongue on the dart. He's capable of feats such as:

* Creating a blast of high wind emanating from the dart as it strikes its target, knocking back anything around it.
* Guiding the dart with high accuracy or across long distances by controlling the flow of wind around it.
* Shooting a distant object with his blood still on the dart, thus turning it into a remote sensor for his cellular radio.

Problems
--------

Cloud is easily detectable via radio apparatus. He also has problems with shorting out devices with built-in radios (such as cell phones), and must rely on older analog systems.

Scenario
--------

The Holiday Inn hotel in Monterrey has been taken over by three dozen gunmen and three confirmed superhumans. The police attempted a peaceful negotiation, but the negotiator was killed in what appeared to be a blast of green lightning from an upstairs window, and a strike team that attempted to infiltrate the hotel was seriously injured and forced to retreat.

A block away, a black man in a long leather duster walks out of the Carl's Jr. and shoulders a heavy duffel bag. He approaches the hotel. He's got a blowgun, and he fires a few silent darts at the hotel entrances as he makes a circuit of the building.

He gets closer to one of the doors. The blowgun gets put away; instead, he takes out inflated condoms filled with tap water. The door opens, but he seems to be expecting it to. He throws the improvised water balloons just as it comes open. The water boils itself into steam almost instantly; there's now a scalding cloud of vaporous hell waiting for whoever was coming out, which turns out to be a couple of armed men. They fall screaming, and the man in the duster waves the steam aside with a gesture and walks inside.

He shoots a few more darts as he walks, making sure they stick to the walls and ceilings where he aimed. Each one glistens red; a drop of blood still hangs heavy on them. And as the gang fans out into the hotel's corridors, he's ready. Drinking fountains explode in a burst of steam as men go by, set off by some unguessable trigger. Fire hoses, coiled up for emergencies, similarly explode when men with guns walk past them. Every source of water in the hotel's hallways seems to be a death trap waiting to be sprung.

A few members of the gang think they've cornered their guy. That lasts until the fire extinguisher behind them explodes, sending shrapnel everywhere.

The hostile supers are with their hostages. Each feels a slight sting in their neck, followed by searing pain as the air around the injury suddenly superheats itself. As they fall writhing, the black man darts in and brusquely orders the hostages up and out.

Cloud is on the roof by the time the cops arrive. As they fan out to take stock of the unexpectedly neutralized hostage crisis, he pulls a foil-wrapped burger from his pocket and goes to work on it with a smile.

* "Ex-Army Ranger but doesn't talk about it."
* "I play at being a voodoo sorcerer, but I'm really a kid from New York."
* "You should never see me coming."
* "Regeneration means never having to care about pain."
* "Play hero until bored, play mercenary until rich, repeat."
