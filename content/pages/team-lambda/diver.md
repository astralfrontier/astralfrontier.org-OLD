# Diver

Diver is a member of Team Lambda.

Diver is a mixed-ethnicity woman. She normally wears black body armor and a face-covering mask, using her light manipulation abilities to disguise or conceal herself as needed. She dislikes bright light and stays in the shadows when possible. Her ancestry has given her an exotic attractiveness, and she works out to maintain her physical fitness.

Position
--------

Diver is the team ninja. She can move silently, masquerade visually as other people or disappear entirely, defeat security systems which depend on light, and create convincing holograms as distractions. When cornered, she is quite capable of defending herself by using light and darkness offensively.

Past
----

Diver is the daughter of an American G.I. and a Vietnamese woman. She came to America at a young age with her mother; the pair settled in Anchorage, Alaska.

She fell in with a rough crowd growing up, the children of the frontiersmen who call the cold northern state home. Ever anxious to discover the world, and unsure of her own identity, the girl entered a dangerous experimental phase. She went to new places, sampled new experiences, took new risks. She spent part of her teens working in bars catering to Asian expatriates, staying just this side of prostitution - a line she never crossed over. Her mother's stern religious upbringing and her own sense of pride kept her afloat.

Diver never let herself become a victim. Even when she was dancing at clubs, she made sure she was armed and had friends nearby. She cultivated a closely-knit support network, and she made sure to look for signs of abuse (chemical, sexual, or otherwise) in her closest friends.

Her experimentation never abated; she simply became more cautious about it, and more capable in handling herself. Once she would feel secure with her present depth, she would dive a little deeper. And in due course she came to the attention of a splinter religious sect operating throughout the state. Members of the sect offered her work smuggling drugs and guns into and out of the state, and her work kept her close to the docks and moving through the underbelly of Alaska.

She acquired her powers early in life - how, she does not say. Her abilities came to the attention of her handler in the sect, who saw in her a chance to gain influence by remaking her into a religious figurehead whose abilities were divinely ordained. For a time, she considered it.

As part of that consideration, she explored the sect's hidden rooms and secret goings-on more fully - the promise of worship had given her a new perspective on what limits she ought to respect. What she found was not merely the seamy religious cult she thought she worked for, but a cesspit of dark dealings that went far beyond making money from the black market. She exposed what she could, then fled. The sect's enforcers were not far behind.

Always careful, this experience convinced Diver that she needed more than self-assurance. In a dangerous world (the only one she knew), she needed to become dangerous to survive.

Personality
-----------

Diver is reserved, cautious, willing to take risks but careful to make a sober assessment of them beforehand. She models her persona after the ninja of Japan, the sulsa of Korea, or the Lin Kuei of China. She works independently, going where she wills, and enjoys life from a safe distance.

Her feelings of respect or disrespect are very strong. She has no patience for people who get themselves or others into needless trouble, but she has strong bonds of friendship with anyone who shows care and consideration for others.

Powers
------

Diver can absorb, move, or re-emit light waves. She uses this power for a variety of purposes, most of which have a ninja flavor:

* Invisibility or illusionary disguises
* Creation of holographic images
* A "laser blade", where she emits a large amount of light as a coherent cutting beam for a short time
* Remote viewing, by pulling light from other areas closer to her eyes
* Creation of zones of darkness, or disorienting flashes of bright light
* Duplication of retinal patterns and manipulation of other sorts of light-based sensors

Problems
--------

Diver is still pursued by the sect - she was not the only superhuman to cross their path, and not everyone is willing to turn down godhood. She relies on her current team for protection against the sect, should they ever really track her down.

She has something of a danger addiction, despite her discipline. She has been known to go looking for trouble (but always has something to justify doing so).

* "In a dangerous world, the people who will survive must also be dangerous."
* "I should stay in the shadows, where it's safe."
* "I don't want to talk about it."
* "I'm like a shark. If I stop moving, I'll die."
* "Everyone needs a solid core of friends."

Scenario
--------

Phil says, "She gets made by a cultie. It's a really random thing. Some guy off a ship from Alaska in the bad side of town. She sees him and she isn't sure if he's seen her. So she has to follow him and make sure."

Phil says, "Weighing up the ways this can go. Will she have to kill him to keep him from reporting in? Is this really random or did they come here on purposelooking for her? She can't know that. And if this is a hunt, he might not be alone. There might be others in this crowd on this city street full of off-duty longshoremen and Chinese sailors."

Phil says, "She can call her team. But that will cause such a mess."

Phil says, "Maybe she doesn't want to because this is fun for her, in some deranged way. They've had her stuck in this town for weeks shadowing gold smugglers and drug mules. Not a real hunt at all."
