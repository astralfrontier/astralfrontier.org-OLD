# Writer's Block

I've been writing on and off for awhile. My strength is ideas and settings, but my weakness is plots and feeling blocked or frustrated.
Here's a short list of rules I think are helping overcome these things.

1. Everything you write has a narrator and an audience. Identify the narrator. Identify the audience.
2. Your writing doesn't explain the idea. Your writing makes people realize the idea on their own.
3. "This is how it is... ," the story is saying. "Not how you are used to being. Not how you are used to thinking. But like this."
4. Stories don't happen to characters. Characters happen to the world. Start with the character.
