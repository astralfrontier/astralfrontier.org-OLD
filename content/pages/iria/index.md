# Iria

## History

Though the true origins of the world of Iria are now locked away in myths, legends and campfire tables, most scholars and sages continue to fight over it fiercely. Even events as recent as a millennium ago are held in debate among the wise. The true history of Iria is one of betrayal, destruction, and grievous accidents.

## The Unknown Age

Before the power of Zoa dominated the globe, Iria was little more than darkness and uncertainty. Humanity was a cowering creature on the face of an unknown world, with only hints from its dreams that something else existed. It fought itself and bled and died; at that time, man fought man, not monster.

In time, mankind learned of wizardry, and discovered the existence of the Other. At the same time, their early experiments brought forth hundreds or thousands of creatures - the first Vores. The practice of magic would only be perfected in the Second Epoch, but its power was demonstrated when the first Elves emerged.

Bred from Human and Other stock, the Elves brought with them the true powers of magic. Their unearthly blood and lore gave them an advantage at first, but humanity soon learned this new and difficult skill. Other races were to follow - curious Vores whose shape was a curious blend of human and beast, or a distorted reflection of the body of man. In this way, Kobolds, Goblins, Dwarves and other races sprang into being. Many of them wielded strange powers, and they or their descendants demonstrated innate talents for spellcasting.

Some human kingdoms were not satisfied with magic. They wanted a method of keeping their citizens safe from Vores and other predators, a method that didn't itself attract the attention of the monsters. They turned to what is today known as mechanistry: the disciplines of science and technology. They forged armaments and armor, discovered the principles of chemistry and physics, and fought back the tide of creatures.

Nobody truly knows how long this state of affairs lasted, nor is anything truly known about this time. No records survive to the present day. However, enough facts are evident to permit sages to draw some of the aforementioned conclusions.

## The Fall of Zoa

Thousands upon thousands of years ago, mankind welcomed the Elves, Dwarves, Halflings and Gnomes into its midst, along with several other races whose existence has now been forgotten. For of the many beings that walked the world, only these five races have survived to this day as civilized beings. The others were destroyed, driven back into barbarism, or spread in a diaspora to the ends of Iria.

The world at that time was a single enormous island, a continent of surpassing beauty and abundant natural resources. From shore to shore it was a Hegemony of nations, the foremost of which was Zoa. And the crown jewel of Zoa was the shining city of Zandread. Thousands of square miles in size, populated by millions upon millions of citizens, and powered by the most advanced mechanistry of the age, the entire city was itself a great machine. Glass and steel, crystal and mithril, alloys and devices of great cunning cocooned its citizens from the teeming Vore hordes that even then infested the world.

The prosperity of Zandread, and the power of its rulers, earned the envy and admiration of the great nations of Iria. Each paid their tributes to Zoa and in exchange were protected from the ravages of the monster races. Even the great Dragons submitted themselves to the aerial warships of the “king of nations”. And in the end, Zoa was brought low.

At this time, the Courts as modern Irians know them did not exist. The practice of magic was far inferior to the mechanistry of the Zoan people, but in certain of the outlying nations who chafed under the yoke of Zoa's power it was seen as the only way to compete.

Zoa's mechanistry was capable of manipulating the boundaries between Iria and the Other, mostly to draw on its power to fuel the city's unending thirst for energy, and it was thought by the leaders of three nations in particular that Zoa's own technology could become its downfall. Guilefully they formed an alliance with powerful creatures from the Other, summoned by sorcerery. They would unleash the “gates” in Zandread, flooding the great city with entities from the Other. These invading creatures would then steal as much entropy as they wished. Zandread would be destroyed and Zoa's power would be broken.

The plan worked better than anybody had ever hoped - unfortunately. The foremost magicians of the rogue nations used their powers to escort an invading strike team into Zandread and change the operation of the machines from which the city drew its power. It was then that the conspirators realized their mistake. Their allies could freely pass through the portals. So could every other creature of the Other with sufficient power to make the transit and survive the onslaught of a very surprised city defense system. Creatures of every type, description and motivation entered Zandread and spread throughout the city. Chaotic energies, unhindered by the careful craft of the magician, transformed hapless citizens into unrecognizable shapes, or wreaked havoc on the airships and powered transit systems used to haul people or cargo. Airships, thousands of tons in mass, fell from the sky or split into fragments of diamond and rowan wood, showering the city in a devastating rain.

Zandread was indeed destroyed, as the conspirators had hoped, but the voracious appetite of the Other's most powerful beings was not to be sated. Turning the city's own mechanistry to their purposes, they opened yet larger portals and drew the entropic force at the very heart of Iria through and into the Other.

The world cracked like an egg. The supercontinent split apart, driving a wedge through the western third of Zandread. Super-earthquakes devastated the entire continent, destroying in hours the cities that humanity had labored for centuries to build and maintain. The rush of water into the gap flooded out the coastal settlements; only the few sturdy fortresses of the inlands survived in any fashion.

Mountain ranges appeared, thrusting themselves through the bedrock of the planet. Rivers and lakes were destroyed or relocated violently. A billion sentient beings died in a day, not knowing the reasons for their fate. Iria would have been utterly destroyed if the mechanistry of the city itself, the instrument of Iria's damnation, hadn't failed under the strain.

When the survivors re-emerged, their world had utterly changed.

## The Dark Ages

Nobody quite knew what to make of things. Zoa had been utterly destroyed, and the land around Zandread for hundreds of miles in every direction was infested with Vores. The few nations whose leadership survived the crisis were able to muster some aid to survivors, but many thousands of people starved or died of exposure.

Magic, the under-appreciated tool of the lesser nations, was now considered the tool for rebuilding and survival. Very few of the survivors understood the intricacies of mechanistry and still fewer - the ones who truly understood what had happened - felt like advertising their knowledge, for fear of another apocalypse. They recorded their now-precious lore, but few dared to continue to practice the art of science.

Separated by monster-infested oceans now, the surviving kingdoms pledged to their neighbors on each continent that rebuilding and life would be their priority. To a great extent, they were faithful to this promise. The harsh life that typified the early years caused a great deal of friction and even a few wars, but for the most part people were able to see their way through without killing each other.

“The Old Kingdoms”, as they were to later to be called, grew outward and downward - the advantages of subterranean defenses against Vores was proven time and again in skirmishes against the monsters. The race of Dwarves, in particular, gained in power as their stonecunning was called into play to reinforce the defenses of kingdom after kingdom.

Over time, as tunnels were abandoned in a particularly virulent outbreak of Vore attack on the surface, some of the monsters themselves began to experiment with underground life. Mimicking as always the behavior of their prey, some Vores began to spend their lives entirely underground. Many became bitter enemies of the Dwarves, and these feuds between Vore and Dwarf continue to this day.

The Lastlands, a contingent of the Old Kingdoms who had actually survived the cataclysm of Zoa, were the first to learn the existence of the Courts. Their spellcasters were approached by emissaries of the Other's most powerful forces, who had observed the formation of monarchy and other forms of government on Iria and had over time sought to emulate it. The Courts wished for peace with Irians, and in exchange they would offer the limitless power of the Other in the service of all Irians - magical healing, aid, protection and defense would be within reach at last, as these practices were formerly very rare among the practitioners of magic. Not that the Courts were in any sense altruistic - they saw the mortal races of Iria as the best source of the entropy they so desperately craved.

From the Lastlander Kingdoms, the first “clerics” spread forth in the wake of the devastation - priests of the forty-eight Courts which had come into being, although only fifteen of them sought mortal agents. Even the Court of Mechanistry had its adherents, although the practice of their art was considered a dangerous undertaking. At first distrusted, the appointed representatives of the Courts proved their worth soon enough. These hard-working men and women healed the sick, drove away disease, and did all they could to ease the suffering of a troubled planet.

Dragons, the most fearsome of Vores, had not been seen on Iria since the devastation of Zandread. Fifteen hundred years ago, hundreds of dragons were seen congregating on the western edge of what is now the Malvet Continent. Nobody knew then what significance their presence held, but all agreed that more Vores in the area could only make things worse.

## The Ark

A thousand years ago, a kingdom of necromancers and wizards arose on the northwestern continent. Carving their capitol city into the face of the eldritch mountains which brooded in the far north, they and their skeletal servants began a bloody war of conquest which spread like a plague across the continent. Though many people saw no immediate reason for this program of conquest, the dark masters of the Black Lands (as they were later called) were serving the interests of the Court of Midnight. They were sent to crush all in their path, to turn the entire continent into a dark-shrouded grave upon which the Midnight Court would feast.

The Elves, whose original and still-beloved homeland stood last in the path of the invading enemy, were sorely beset. Slow to reproduce, they were unable to match the necromancers' armies in number. The Elves appealed to their patron, the Court of Air. It responded.

The entire Elven homeland was physically wrenched forth from the earth and cast adrift into the sky, forever isolating the Elves from the predations of the necromantic armies. Now safe, the Elves were free to begin a strategy of counter-attack. They turned to the avian life of their homeland and, through strange magics, bred these creatures larger and larger for use as riding beasts. They developed mystic techniques and rediscovered some of the ancient lore of their ancestors. And when they were ready, they attacked.

Though the Black Lands had time to prepare as well, they were unable to defend themselves against the great thrust of the Elves, based as they were on a flying island. The elves rained down alchemical fire and magical flame from atop their eagles; they ringed the battlefields with explosives and set them off as the skeletons and zombies of their former neighbors retreated. They expended their own life-essences in crafting spheres of magical negation which persist to this day. And in the end, though they fought valiantly, they were unable to entirely seal away the threat of the Black Lands. The necromancers retreated into their stronghold of stone, until the Elves were convinced that no more could be done. The other kingdoms of the once-beautiful continent took up the vigil, and the Elves returned to their floating homeland, now dubbed “Ark”.

The war of resubjugation had taken nearly two decades, and by this time the Elven people were actually quite taken with their new home. It was as beautiful as always, and now insured for all time (they thought) against the invading “ground-grippers”.

## The War of the Elements

The Elves had only a limited perspective on the dangers that faced Iria. Forces on every continent, and throughout the islands that dotted the world, were marching under the banner of the Midnight Court. Opposing them were the allied powers of the Day Court, along with most of the Elemental Courts - Air, Earth and Water. Even the Fire Court allied itself to the oppressed enemies of the Midnight Court, though more out of a desire to see an increase in destruction than anything else. Though the powers of the Other had long been feuding in their own realm, it was only the Elves' plea that brought the attention of the Midnight Court's enemies to the plight of their supplicants on Iria.

The Courts, and their priests, sought out and transformed doughty warriors and other promising individuals as champions of their orders. The first Paladins and Elemental Knights were called forth to do battle against the forces of necromancy and corruption. Through the Day Court's patronage, Paladins could smite down the undead scourges that ravaged the lands. The Air and Water Courts fielded warriors of incomparable skill, while the Earth Court's chosen became stalwart defenders of people and places. Even the Fire Court's champions joined in the battle, to rain down flames of Hell on the creatures of the night that stood forth to conquer the world.

It was a long and bitter feud, but as with the Black Lands, peace was restored. Harsh victories were extracted from the battlefield; magic was arrayed against magic. The manifestation of more and more Vores, a side effect of the awesome mystic might being wielded in each battle, only added more chaos to the already-fearsome struggle.

In the end, the combined alliance of the Courts defeated the forces of Midnight, but not conclusively. The next millennium would see a continued trend among spellcasters to meddle with the forces of death and the dead. Never again, though, would necromancy field such a terrible army.

## The Dragons

Five hundred years ago, a world which had enjoyed over four centuries of relative peace was caught unprepared. An old Dwarven settlement, manned through two generations of Dwarves, was the first to fall. The Dragons had come to the largest island in the southern ocean, and they were there to stay.

The Dwarves couldn't stand against their attacks. Nor could the Elves, nor the Humans. Rather than fight an unwinnable fight, they retreated from the islands as best they could. Many communities, unable to retreat in time, simply stayed put. Some were destroyed; some were left in complete peace. It was not discovered until later the reasons for this apparent immunity.

The Courts, locked in endless political games with each other, saw no reason to intervene. If the mortal races disliked Dragons, they could move. There was plenty of room for everyone. Nor would any single Court acknowledge responsibility in permitting the Dragons to enter Iria.

Regardless of the personal feelings of those who had once inhabited the lush and beautiful islands, no further actions were taken. The Dragons were left alone, and as it turned out they confined themselves to the island chain on which they had started settling.

Soon after, the clerics of a half-dozen Courts made announcements to the leaders and peoples of their respective nations: the Courts would no longer intervene in such direct fashions, as they had in the past. Too much had been lost, their otherworldly emissaries said; open conflict would serve nobody. However, they acknowledged the need for Irians to protect themselves.

To this end, chosen priests had petitioned the Courts for some means of defeating the threat of powerful Vores such as Dragons. The answer was simple - priests could call forth their own Vores, and if a Dragon assaulted a community it could be answered with another Dragon. Since that time, the Summoners have been an important part of life in and around the “Dragon's Nest”. The villages and settlements that survived on the islands were, in fact, the earliest homes of Summoners on Iria - they promised to protect and serve the Dragons, and in return the Dragons would serve their needs when called upon. Not every Dragon assented to this bargain, but enough did that peace could be maintained. A bond of trust, albeit a fragile one, was forged on the volcanic islands of the southern sea.

Since that time, Irians have lived and worked and loved and died, as is their nature. Four centuries ago, the Empire of Malvet grew out of the ashes of a trio of warring kingdoms - unified by a single hero, and guided and advised by clerics of the Courts of Mechanistry and Earth, this budding nation-state grew into a continent-spanning Empire with dozens of periphery states. In recent times it has grown autocratic and overburdened, and the widespread mechanistry it employs has made some of the learned question its fate. The sages of history remember all too well the ruins of antiquity in which rest potent weapons whose firing could have defeated any ordinary enemy, and they ask themselves whether some overwhelming and nameless doom could again overtake a technological nation. But only the future will answer that.
