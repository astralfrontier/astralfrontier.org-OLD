= Dream Zones =

In places where magic was recently used, or where spells were recently prepared, a certain amount of [[The Other]]'s residual creative energy takes root.  [[Vores]] can instinctively sense this, and are drawn to it.  Most wielders of magic can also detect it, with time and preparation.  The longer that spellcasting or spell preparation takes place in an area, the stronger the residual influence.  Places where magic is regularly used are called '''Dream Zones'''.

Most large towns, and all cities, have contingents of spellcasters.  Thus, any sort of urban settlement must take precautions against Vores.  More isolated areas are wary of spellcasters, and wizards often live in well-fortified towers or keeps to protect themselves from being mobbed by monstrous beasts.  Educated spellcasters realize that the Other taint, while present, is ultimately harmless.  Common folk may not always believe this, and may mistrust arcane casters of all types.

Wizards on the road, who prepare spells at a convenient campsite, are not in any particular danger of a Dream Zone forming - their limited magic simply isn't enough to create such an area, even if the wizard is a powerful archmage of some kind.  However, wizards preparing spells in the same place for long periods of time will inevitably create such an area.
