= Religious beliefs in Malvet =

The empire of [[Malvet]] believes in the sacred rules of [[The Compact]].  However, it is much less wary of the prohibition on technology than other nations in the world.  It fully embraces mechanistry stemming from mechanical or "elemental" principles - including gunpowder and the steam engine.

The Malvet temple system considers itself "reformed" (as opposed to the "unreformed" temples of the rest of the world).  It believes that full cooperation and disclosure with [[The Courts|the Courts]] will avert another tragedy.

The temples have a degree of patience for arcane organizations such as the [[Ordo Annulus]] and the [[Ordo Oneiros]] that other nations lack, but this is widely considered to be a very Malvet-like concession to practicality rather than ideological acceptance of arcane magic.
