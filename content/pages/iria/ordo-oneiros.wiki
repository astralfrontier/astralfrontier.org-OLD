The '''Ordo Oneiros''' is an international magical association.  It has some ties to the [[Ordo Annulus]] and the [[Ordo Sanguis]].  It is composed of spellcasters of all types, and loremasters without specific magical training.

The Order is dedicated to a scholarly investigation of [[The Other|the Other]] and its inhabitants.  They do not deal with such creatures directly; that's for the temples.  But they do collect information from friendly priests, and have sometimes advised temples on obscure points of mysticism.

The Order pays considerable bounties on unusual or "interesting" [[Vores|Vore]] specimens, dead or alive (although the authorities much prefer dead).
