Three different calendars have been used since the time of the Compact.  The most widespread method of timekeeping is now called the Sil Calendar, and it puts the date as 2321 AC (After Compact).

:''Main Article:'' [[The Compact]]

Recorded history starts with a document called the Compact.  It is the world's oldest living document.  It was graven on metal and spread throughout the world.  Many museums today have a copy, and archaeological dig sites regularly uncover more examples of it.

The Compact was a treaty between several ancient kingdoms.  It laid out four sacred rules, and followed them with commentary and other adjurations.  Most of the text is only of interest to historians.  However, it is known that a cataclysmic event immediately preceded the Compact, and most people believe the rules that it describes will avert another terrible disaster.  For this reason, most nations on Iria follow the sacred rules, or at least an interpretation of them.
