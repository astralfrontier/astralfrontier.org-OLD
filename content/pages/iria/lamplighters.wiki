= Lamplighters =

The '''Lamplighters''' are an international order of knighthood.  They dedicate themselves to creating and maintaining lamps of [[Sacred Light]] along the major roads of the world, keeping travelers safe from [[Vores]].  Their secondary purpose is the elimination of Vores from the world, although they do this more by encouraging other nations and groups to fight than by going on a crusade by themselves.

Their mission is based on the fourth sacred rule of the Charter: "All Men must stand in brotherhood against the menace of the Vores".  Accordingly, the Lamplighters are welcomed (in their official capacity, and when wearing their armor and livery) in almost any civilized nation in the world.  This level of trust has made them wary of internal corruption.  They have been ruthless in purging their own ranks of extremists and spies, although a few cases mar their record.

== Relations with the Temples ==

The Lamplighters' use of arcane magic in their lamps has drawn criticism from many church leaders.  Still, none of the temples have ever made an effort to interfere with them.  They make every effort to cooperate with the temples.
