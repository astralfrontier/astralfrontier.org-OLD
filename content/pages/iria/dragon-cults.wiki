'''Dragon Cults''' (or Vore cults) are religious groups who worship dragons and other powerful, intelligent [[Vores]].  They are most prominent around the [[Dragon's Nest]], but they can be found in any area where powerful Vores are present.

Dragon Cults are frequently led by a charismatic dragon-blooded or demon-blooded cleric.  A few renegade [[Summoners]] are known to promote their own Dragon Cults, encouraging worship of their summoned avatars as a means to hold power over the group.
