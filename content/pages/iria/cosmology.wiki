A Mandala is a diagram of sacred geometry, usually consisting of one or more circles, or "orbits", marked with points called "nodes".  The nodes of different circles in the diagram can contain "concurrences", or connections between them.  Mandalas are thought to describe the flow of energy through all things.

The study of energy flow through the world itself is called [[Geomancy]].
