The '''Ordo Sanguis''', or Order of Blood, is a secretive group with an ominous name.  In spite of this, their actual mission is relatively benign.

Theorizing that power flows through blood and the "blood lines" of inheritance in a fashion similar to [[Geomancy]], the Order studies "demihumans" and [[Vores]].  They wish to understand how the power of [[Glamour and Dross|Glamour]] seems to be an inherited quality.  They gather geneological records and study old families.  They have devised theories about magical potential based on their findings, although they still remain obscure.
