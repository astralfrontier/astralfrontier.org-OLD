= Zoa =

The ancient civilization called '''Zoa''' dates from before recorded history.  Relics of that time are sometimes excavated in wild areas and along the coasts of the Zalan Ocean.  Many discoveries have been made underwater as well, and the coastal city of Tendives does brisk and profitable trade in such archaeological finds.

Zoa had dealings with [[The Other|the Other]], prior to the creation of [[The Courts|the Courts]].  The world-destroying calamity that fractured the Zalan continent into its three pieces destroyed Zoa in a single day, along with the prehistoric super-city of the ancients.  Whatever happened, it led to the injunctions against dealing with the Other that are written in [[The Compact|the Compact]].

Written records from Zoa are exceedingly rare.  The 'dwarven runes' are linguistic offshoots of their runic alphabet, and it is also known that the ''position'' and ''ordering'' of the characters and strokes were magically significant.  Some of this lore has been transmitted down and is reflected (albeit muddily) in the arcane tradition.  Unfortunately, with the destruction of Zoa, the necessary geomantic patterns of the world have shifted sufficiently enough for the hidden secrets of their written characters to be lost.
