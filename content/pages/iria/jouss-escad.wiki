'''Jouss Escad''' is a subterranean kingdom of the Dwarves.  It spans thousands of miles, and millions of inhabitants call it home.

The tunnel systems of Jouss Escad were originally created by burrowing [[Vores]] called Dadaedas.  They were massive burrowing beasts, resembling slimy octopi with giant acidic pads at the end of their tentacles.  They were exterminated (or so the rulers of Jouss Escad will firmly maintain) and the gigantic tunnels they left behind were further refined and expanded by dedicated craftsmen.

Like many other Dwarven nations, Jouss Escad has three layers.  The ''metropolis'' consists of the residential and small business areas, with well-guarded and fortified ramps leading up to the surface world.  The ''foundation'' holds the heavy industry and storage areas.  The ''forge'' is the deepest of the layers, and sinks down almost to the magma flows that course below the world's surface.  Here, in the raging heat and torrid atmosphere, Dwarven craftsmanship finds its greatest expression.
