Religion on Iria is abstract and prosaic.  The relationship between worshippers and their patron powers is more like a feudal relationship to a lord, and the temples that dot Iria see themselves in a profitable political alliance with their Court.

== Myth and Legend ==

The Courts do not offer any special claim to the creation of the world, nor any hints as to its ultimate end.  Indeed, they are necessarily as ignorant as mankind of these ultimate mysteries.  As far as anyone knows, no member of the Courts, much less any sentient entity anywhere in the Other, has lived as long as the world.

== Temples ==

The Courts demand Dross from the people of Iria.  In return, they offer Glamour - the stuff of sorcery and magic.  The temples mediate with the Courts to make this exchange.  They sacrifice material goods with good Dross, make ritual oblations of the elements, and conduct gatherings of worshippers.

On the mortal side, temples receive regular donations and tithes from its worshippers.  These go toward the purchase of ritual components, pay for the temple's operation, and support the priests and clerics which work there.  Temples regularly offer healing magics to anyone who comes to them, only charging if the recipient is able to afford the fee.  In other cases, the cost of healing is subsidized by regular tithing.
