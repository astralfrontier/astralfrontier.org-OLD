A lot of what I like is upbeat and optimistic. There is some outright fantasy that I really enjoy, and some explicitly comedic series (like Slayers), but mostly I just like seeing peoples' better natures pay off.

* [Azumanga Daioh!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AzumangaDaioh) - the archetypical slice-of-high-school-life anime. Surpassingly sweet and funny as hell.
* [Fairy Tail](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail) - One Piece With Wizards. The most destructive mage's guild in the world goes on a series of adventures. See it on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/fairy-tail).
* [Full Metal Panic](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic) - high school students, a mercenary organization with super robots, and a whole season of comedy filler.
* [Full Moon o Sagashite](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMoonOSagashite) - 12-year-old Mitsuki is granted the power to turn into a 16-year-old idol... by a pair of shinigami, or "death gods", who are there because she has a year to live.
* [Haiyore! Nyarko-san](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaiyoreNyarkoSan) - a 12-episode anime, along with some related Flash videos. Mythos Musume with a surprising amount of familiarity with Lovecraftian lore. See it on [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/nyarko-san-another-crawling-chaos).
* [Kamichu!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kamichu) - an adorable series about a high school girl who becomes a god, somehow or other. She solves problems, meets aliens, and tries to find love.
* [Mahou Sensei Negima!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MahouSenseiNegima) - Ken Akamatsu turns a harem series into a shounen fighting series. The fans rejoice. Sadly ended thanks to a conflict over ownership rights.
* [Medaka Box](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox) - a thorough deconstruction of the Mary Sue archetype, and of many other tropes. Super-powered "abnormals" at high school. See it on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/medaka-box), though tragically it seems the anime doesn't have Kumagawa at all.
* [Naruto](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto) - yes, say what you will, the manga is pretty good. The anime made some interesting changes here and there. See it on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/naruto), which I'm guessing is one of the most viewed URLs on the Internet.
* [PaniPoni Dash](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PaniPoniDash) - Japanese cultural weirdness as a child genius goes to teach at a highly atypical Japanese school. See it on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/pani-poni-dash).
* [Princess Tutu](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu) - two seasons of fairy tale with a weird spin on the Magical Girl archetype. See it on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/princess-tutu).
* [Summer Wars](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SummerWars) - it's about families and MMOs. Absolute must-see.
* [Toradora!](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Toradora) - a sweet, more believable take on the tsundere personality. See it on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/toradora).
* [Vandread](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread) - the battle of the sexes goes interplanetary as ship crews from two warring planets (one all men, the other all women) must learn to work together against a common foe. See it on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/vandread).

### Dark

Then again.... there are some shows I like where bad things happen to people, conspiracy is the rule, or the apocalypse has already hit (or is on its way).

* [Code Geass](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass) - a dark, involving story of rebellion and royalty in a world with giant robots and mysterious mental powers.
* [Darker Than Black](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack) - mood: exactly what it sounds like. Superpowered "contractors" act as mercenary assassins in a global conspiracy.
* [Ergo Proxy](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ErgoProxy) - weird and postmodern, with moments of comedy. A dysfunctional family unit making its way across a desolate landscape. See it on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/ergo-proxy).
* [Ghost in the Shell](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex) - the archetypical post-cyberpunk anime, following the elite law enforcement team of Section 9 as they confront terrorists, corrupt government officials, and themselves. See it on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/ghost-in-the-shell-stand-alone-complex).
* [Guilty Crown](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GuiltyCrown) - a reclusive schoolboy gains the power to summon weapons from his friends, and joins a resistance movement with ties to his own past. A spiritual successor to Code Geass. See it on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/guilty-crown).
* [Witchblade](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Witchblade) - the Japanese take on the Witchblade franchise. A young mother balances raising her daughter, getting drunk, and fighting inhuman creatures spawned by a corrupt megacorporation.
* [Wolfs Rain](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WolfsRain) - four wolves able to adopt human form journey across the world in search of a fabled paradise. See it on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/wolfs-rain).

### Giant Robot

Ever since watching Robotech when I was young, I was interested in mecha anime. Some of the titles above have mecha (Code Geass in particular), but these are the shows that revolve around the concept.

* [Gaiking](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gaiking) - A complete remake of a '70s anime. Hot-blooded robot pilots fighting as part of a planet-wide insurrection against an evil empire. A stupendously genre-savvy Big Bad dominates the latter half of the series. There's also a live-action movie. See it on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/gaiking).
* [RahXephon](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RahXephon) - music, Mayan mythology, and giant robots. A reconstruction of the quasi-mystical direction Super Robot sometimes took.
* [Reideen](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Raideen) - the 2000s series, not the first two. Really makes you appreciate what a Super Robot, played straight, might look like. If you don't mind spoilers, you can see the final move it uses [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynZsX2Ouq0A). Slightly less spoileriffic, but no less impressive, is [its first transformation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pS3dHVajHlA) - you think "a metal mecha, sure", until the wings start to *flap*. This is what a Solar Warstrider looks like in Exalted.

#### Sunrise/[Brave Robots](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BraveSeries) series:

* [Brave of the Sun Fighbird](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBraveFighterOfSunFighbird) - a somewhat naive and idealistic show, but that's its charm. Energy beings from space transmute rescue vehicles into transforming bodies for themselves, much to the surprise of their creator.
* [GaoGaiGar](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar) - the definition of hot-blooded Super Robot.

### Unwatched

This is stuff I've had recommended or heard about, but don't really know much about.

* [Hidan no Aria](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HidanNoAria) - a spin on historical figures reincarnated.
* [Our Home's Fox Deity](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/WagayaNoOinariSama) - there's a home, there's a fox deity. See it on [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/our-homes-fox-deity)
