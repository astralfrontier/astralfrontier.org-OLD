# Insane Protagonists?

It's commonly accepted that Lovecraft's horror stories are filled with characters who go mad from cosmic revelation, or when confronted with unearthly monsters. I'm doing a survey of his work to assess that belief.

| **Title** | **Protagonist** | **Verdict**
| _The Tomb_ | Jervas Dudley | Possible hallucinations involving visiting the tomb or past life. Otherwise rational.
| _Dagon_ | Unnamed | Suicidal due to experiences at sea. May be stalked by inhuman beings.
| _Polaris_ | Unnamed | Doubts reality in favor of a dream.
| _Beyond the Wall of Sleep_ | Unnamed | Sane, depending on your interpretation of the reality of the messages he receives.
| _The Transition of Juan Romero_ | Unnamed | Presumably sane, possibly isolated hallucination.
| _The White Ship_ | Basil Elton | Possible deep hallucination.
| The Statement of Randolph Carter | Randolph Carter | Memory loss or hallucination.
| Celephais | Kuranes | Presumably sane, if Randolph Carter's later testimony can be regarded as reliable.
| From Beyond | Unnamed | Believed by police to have been hypnotized by Crawford Tillinghast.
| The Temple | Karl Henrich, Graf von Altberg-Ehrenstein | Either hallucinatory or mind-controlled, depending on your belief. Otherwise rational-seeming.
| The Picture in the House | Unnamed | Presumed sane, but fearful.
| The Nameless City | Unnamed | Presumed sane.

| Hypnos | Unnamed | Drug addicted and hallucinatory.
| Herbert West-Reanimator | Unnamed | Sane but scared.
| The Hound | Unnamed | Presumed sane, hunted.
| The Lurking Fear | Unnamed | Sane, some fainting spells and other fear reactions.
| The Rats in the Walls | Baron de la Poer | Cannibalism caused by shock, possible hallucinations (possibly hereditary).
| The Unnameable | Randolph Carter | Sane but injured.
| The Festival | Unnamed | Serious hallucations, or sane, depending on your interpretation.
| The Shunned House | Unnamed | Sane.

| The Thing on the Doorstep | Daniel Upton | Arrested for murder, discharged with clean bill of mental health in non-canonical sources.
