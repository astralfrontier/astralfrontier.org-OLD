Shanghai at night emits light in every color the human eye is capable of perceiving. Mixed between these are the lights in the infrared or ultraviolet spectrum, visible only to cybernetic eyes. James Bond pretended to ignore these and continue his facade as a tourist.

The car only needed one hand on the wheel to almost drive itself. Q Branch implants did the rest. Some of the men and women who created his systems, reflected Bond, might have been born and raised on these very streets. The British Empire recruits and retains the best technical talent from anywhere in the world using money, challenge, leverage, and the occasional kidnapping. But culturally, they had assembled Bond entirely from British ingredients.

Bond's attention refocused itself: his quarry had pulled into a car park. He followed. When two men stepped out of their automobile, impeccably dressed, and crossed the sky bridge to the consumerplex, Bond was twenty feet behind them. When the face scanners began projecting individually tailored advertising at the crowd by lasering their retinas, Bond's subtle defenses kept them from obstructing his view or capturing his identity. And when they stepped down a convenient hallway marked by ultraviolet tracers on the wall and signed the gestures that provided admittance to a private club, Bond was there.

He straightened his tie, checking it against the ever-present reflective surfaces of the club's walls. Behind every one would be a camera. Everything here would be recorded, analyzed, dissected. Nobody here cared who you were, or wanted to know. They just wanted to know if you obeyed protocol. The weight of unimaginable wealth and power pressing down on a man makes him act a certain way. Con men, cops, and other undesirables could be filtered out by their actions, however impeccable their credentials. Bond smiled to himself. To catch a shark, send another shark. As for the mirrors, they fit too. These men couldn't resist admiring themselves.

Bond's gait passed muster. The bouncers didn't approach him, nor notice as he went on shadowing his marks. He couldn't follow them all the way to their table to listen in on the conversation. Was there a way? Of course there was. The omnipresent smoke in the room wasn't just there for the patrons' indulgence of the ancient vice. It was also intended to mark out laser microphones and the like. The whole room was a Faraday cage, too - radio reception was blocked. But they couldn't block signals inside.

Bond watched everything but his marks for a few minutes. Then they ordered, and he moved. The young Chinaman serving the table stepped out of the back only to be confronted with a quiet but unhappy British gentleman, evidently unhappy with his drink. Bond spent a good twenty seconds berating the poor fellow in Chinese after that, then resumed in English. "Now replace it, on the double." The poor fellow could only bow and nod, looking down deferentially. That was good, mused Bond. He'd been so focused on one drink that he neglected to see what happened with the other.

And when that fateful glass found its way to the table of Bond's marks, the circuit his artificial eyes had laser-etched onto the surface started broadcasting, powered by the transceiver in Bond's pocket. The pair were speaking in French, as expected. French was the language of love, the former language of diplomacy, and the bane of anyone doing low-fidelity wiretapping; vital nuance could be lost in a moment of static. Still, Bond was sure he made it out well enough. He got a name, a place, a time, and an amount, and so much spy work boils down to these essentials.
