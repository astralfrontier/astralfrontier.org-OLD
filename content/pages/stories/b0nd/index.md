This is an experiment to see how well James Bond holds up in a cyberpunk future. A few ground rules:

1. Bond is Bond is Bond. Is he a different man using an alias, is 007 a role, or is it the same guy? You'll never know. "Bond" is a mask, and he is all mask, almost all the time.
2. It's not about the gadgets, it's about the mission.
3. He must actually work in the context of the setting. If a cyberpunk Bond can't survive a cyberpunk future, the experiment has failed.
