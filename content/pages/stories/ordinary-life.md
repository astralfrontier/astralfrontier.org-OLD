# Ordinary Life

Modular Citizen DQ-744-13 lives and works in an apartment block in the capital city of his home planet of Delagos. It's been a few years since he finished his secondary education, and he's finally settling into the routine of his work. He has one hobby: being the 83,449,762nd candidate for Roboconversion.

Ever since the Delagos Empire invaded the distant planet Earth (763 light years away, reachable in 2 days via Violet Drive), each Modular Citizen has faced the prospect of Roboconversion. The process takes perhaps a day. It is entirely reversible, but expensive. Only a few citizens undergo it at a time, and usually only one. Candidates are ranked by their physical and mental attributes, their fighting ability, and their patriotic dedication. There are two ways to advance as a candidate: retake the tests, or when the Earthlings' giant robot Furokaizer Z to destroys the current Roboconversion candidate in battle.

13 isn't likely to be chosen in his lifetime. He knows this, but isn't sure how he feels about it. Some part of him feels that it's his responsibility to advance his candidacy to its maximum level. Other parts argue (whether from cowardice or just common sense) that he should let the real potential candidates advance the quickest, that his potential isn't that great, and that the government knows best.

So 13 consoles himself by involving himself in the war effort in other ways. He's part of the "83 Million Club" on Delagos Network's online discussion forums, where every candidate from 83,000,000 to 83,999,999 are automatically enrolled. He writes encouraging messages to the top thousand candidates, telling them that he and his block-mates support them and wish them well. He reviews videos of the Earthlings' giant robot battles against the previous conversion candidates with his fellow fans, and makes notes on suggested weapons or tactics.

When DQ-744-13 receives a message one day, he sends it out to his fellow enthusiasts. He has become the 83,449,761st candidate. The Earthlings have defeated the Clawfacer in space. Quietly the group mourns the loss of TS-991-03, who became Clawfacer, and then they go to the bar and get rowdily drunk to celebrate their own advancements in rank.

Recently 13 has taken notice of a woman at the office, MH-274-33, who smiles shyly at him from time to time and stammers when she talks to him. She's cute, and 13 thinks he'd like to talk to her more. He isn't sure how she'll react to his hobby, though, and he privately fears how he'd react if she was a likelier Roboconversion candidate. Still, he's told his friends that he's going to invite her to the next advancement celebration, and they're looking forward to meeting her.

Sometimes 13 looks up at the starry sky and wonders to himself: *What happened to the life I thought I'd lead when I was in school?* He thought about being a starliner pilot or something like it, and office worker is nothing like it. Still, when he thinks about his friends, his online discussion groups, and - more recently - about 33, he feels that this ordinary life is right for him.
