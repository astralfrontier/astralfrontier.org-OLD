# The Rogue's Story

My first memory is walking between earth and water to the manor.

The school for assassins was isolated by the sea and high cliffs. The only approach was a narrow, winding path. On one side was the hungry ocean, and jagged rocks waiting to impale the incautious. On the other was impassable sheer rock. The path was long. The masters of the manor left skins full of fresh water and caches of food. Further down there were gold and gems aplenty, dazzling brightly in the sun. The lesson of the path is that the world keeps luxury and death uncomfortably together.

The knife was our first weapon. Blades in hand, we learned anatomy like surgeons. In the yard, straw-filled dummies had fruits placed where a real person's vital organs could be found. I killed a dozen species of tropical fruit in my training. We learned our poisons, and thus discovered which of the kids would sneak fruit out for themselves at night.

One morning, when I was alone with my teacher in the yard, my latest thrust yielded a blade wet with human blood. I'd seen blood plenty of times, but this was something different, and shocking. "Your first kill," the master explained without a hint of emotion, patting the "dummy" on the shoulder as it began to sag. "Take a day off. Those emotions you're going to start feeling - you need to get those out of the way before you deliberately try to kill someone." He saw me start to say something and cut me off. "Don't ask who it was. It doesn't matter who. It never matters. Learn your target, adapt your tactics. But never get attached to who they are."

Weeks went by. The practice continued remorselessly. One early morning, I woke to find myself bound and gagged. Some sort of magical paralysis had been placed on me; the ropes were just an extra precaution. I watched myself carried to the training yard before sunup, and placed inside one of the straw dummies. All day I stood there, motionless and unsuspected. I watched the other trainees practice their knife-work. Every time a presence passed behind me, I expected to find the blade thrust into my own vitals with that same precision. Come nightfall, my master approached where I'd been strung up and began to unbind the ropes. He leaned close to whisper to me. "Your first death. Don't let there be a second one."

The next night, and every night after that, I secured my sleeping quarters. They never got me again.

The manor kept a fully-stocked replica of an alehouse in the cellar, and I learned to make use of everything in it. Broken glass, table legs, chairs, even the logs from the fireplace and the ropes holding up the chandeliers could be used to kill. Students in trouble with their teachers would rebuild it after fighting practice, while those learning the social art would go to town to procure more alcohol and supplies. Other mocked-up areas existed too - a lord's bedroom, a narrow alley made of brick, a well-guarded temple.

Graduation was a gem, pressed into my hand by one of the masters. "Place it on the cliff, with the others. Each gem is a graduate. Find a place for yours. If someone takes it, we'll notify you, and it becomes your duty to get it back. But as long as it's there, you're one of us."
