# The Leap

This was the perfect night to jump. The midnight hour was as black as its name. The few points of light from my hometown felt distant and cold. The intermittent rain had left the iron railings of the bridge slick to the touch, adding the suggestion of danger. The whole business was suitably poetic, which is what suicide demands: it's the last grand gesture you'll ever make. "Suicides are the brave pioneers of the undiscovered country," my note had said in the most flowery handwriting I could muster.

Practical thoughts began to intrude on my dark and glorious solitude. For example, the railing was slick. It might send me over the edge before the psychological climax I demanded of myself. Nothing must be allowed to ruin the moment. Considerations of the height - was it enough to surely put an end to me? The idea of my last few hours spent broken and mangled at the riverbank was repulsive. I bolstered my courage - I'd need it for nothing else, after all - and tried to push such thoughts to the side, and mounted the railing.

"Why are you doing that?" a voice said. More interruptions! I almost lost my balance, and clung instinctively to the railing to steady myself. I was so sure I'd checked the bridge, too.

I looked around. The girl was about twenty feet away. She was dressed all in black, like me. She was about my age. She had a nose ring. Her hair was dark. And she had a look on her face I couldn't make out. The rain was coming down on her, just like on me, but she didn't seem to mind.

"What's it to you?" I asked. She'd interrupted, and I felt anger at the rudeness of her butting into my perfect moment.

"Why are you doing that?" she repeated. She started forward but halted when I flinched toward the edge.

"You wouldn't understand." My retort was a little harsh, but she ignored it as easily as the rain. Who could understand what I felt? Nobody, naturally - which is why this was the only way out.

"You want to tell someone but you're afraid I'll make fun of you. I won't." Her voice was quiet, but it drowned out the rain. It felt like I'd been punched in the gut, and I almost lost my balance again. She didn't move toward me, like I half expected her to, to try and steady me. She just waited. And I got my grip.

"I'm not afraid! Look at this. Do I look afraid?" I demanded angrily.

"You can do something brave and still be afraid. I promise I won't laugh, unless you tell a joke. So please tell me why."

"It's because..!" I stopped. Visions, pictures, memories, feelings - the experiences were so fundamental that I'd never had to verbalize them. Words seemed a cheap and tawdry substitute for the depth of my frustration. Again, that practical thinking intruded: if you actually say it, it will sound petty and stupid.

"I promise I won't make fun of you," she repeated. And that push was enough to get me over the edge, but not the one I'd intended to cross tonight.

"I hate my whole family. They don't understand me at all. I have no friends. My family keeps moving me around, so any friends I do make I don't get to keep.
