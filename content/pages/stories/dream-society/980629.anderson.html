<P>Imaging Justice<P>

<p>I wanted to know..ya might say I paid the price for my curiosity.  Just
another cat with one less life.  I had seen some hazer havin a grand
feast..course, it was in the Wild lands, and if I really thought back, I
wasn't ready ta lead a hazer ta hang wif da dreamers.  Hell, I'm willin ta
bet Ceridh would have my hide, no matter my shape, if he had known what I
was plannin.</p>

<P>See, I'm a dreamer..always have been, but I always kept out the way..a
good girl type.  Yeah, so what if I smoke, wear tight clothes, and swear? I
don't bother anyone...</p>

<P>Anyway, I was watchin that hazer partyin like it was 1999, and I wondered
what it was like ta play and change wif his thoughts.  So I left the secure
doors of the White Kitten, shiftin to an easier travelin form (for me) of
the black panther.  I was careful to make sure the hazer didn't see my
kitty-like self and hid in a near-by set of bushes..ha, Ceridh would prolly
flip if he knew I had slid that bit of greenery into the hazer's scene.</p>

<P>I stood slowly, form shiftin ta match this one's hazin.  The hazer had
taken control--or I let him, I hoped I had at least..so hard ta tell
sometimes--and had me dressed in a pure silk gown..okay it prolly wasn't
pure or even true silk, but it was the guy's dream not mine, so who was I
to complain? Even though he did make me a blond, and I've always been
partial ta brunette or raven black.  He even gave me pixie wings!  These
gossamer flimsy things that I really do doubt could even lift a true pixie.</p>

<P>I cam as I was sure I was bidden.  My lil wings fluttered, and I lifted
myself over ta his side.</p>

<P>"Dear sir?"..my voice was the Tinkerbellish type.  "You and your
men..?"..men? Honestly I hadn't noticed the men til now..just more
constructs of a gifted hazer.."ahem..you and your men are surely in danger
here, for not far off are those who would have your heads." Well, lovely..I
was the do-gooder innocent pixie type..I thought this might have been a
passion haze but I let it run..</p>

<P>"Beautiful one, you need not worry; we are safe.  Come sit with us and
feast."</p>

<P>I sat as requested, or perhaps commanded; he moved closer.  He was so
strong and manly..his arms..all I could think of was those arms around this
pixish form he had given me.  I wanted to feel his warm, broad chest
against mine. </p>

<P>A lil voice in the back of my head kept tellin me to watch it, hazers
could be strong..it kept sayin, no pleadin for me to run, and it seemed
with each warning and with each plea the want to be held, the need to be
touched, just got stronger.</p>

<P>The hazer laughed, as well as his men--they changed, or it seemed they
did; perhaps he had made a joke..I couldn't really understand what was goin
on..I had heard, and knew a lil too, that hazer passion dreams could be a
lil distractin and, at times, disconcertin, but I decided to let it
go...this would be my first..or did he want it that way?</p>

<P>The lil voice had stopped pleadin and was now cussin up a storm...wait,
that voice..Lyn?!?...gods, I had pulled the dayside walker into this.  We
had an agreement: "No passion hazing with strangers"...and if Lyn was in
charge, no passion haze wif Ceridh either--like I'd ever get the chance.</p>

<P>He had noticed; the hazer could tell his virginal pixie wasn't playin the
game right.  He grabbed my arms and pulled me to him.  His lips hard to
mine..his tongue forcin inta me, probin.. He was probin! Lyn was beginnin
ta get scared..no, Lyn was past scared and ready ta call it quits.  I could
feel him searchin us for Lyn's location...the dayside--he wanted..Lyn
screamed.  Dammit, where was Ceridh when I needed him?  Where was my guide
in the land of dreams?  Another thrash in the covers, Lyn was gonna go mad
if this kept up.</p>

<P>I did the only thing I could think of.  I used his probin and pulled him
into tha void..a void where Lyn and I meet..I have never told anyone that
this place exists..never told anyone that Lyn doesn't even have ta be
sleepin for me ta be here..Lyn just needs to want me--to exist and be
round..least that's what we figgered..I pulled him to that void...This
S.o.B was strong, but in the void, we ruled.</p>

<P>I try not to think of what we did..we raped his soul..we ripped the last
bit of humanity from him then took what he considered manhood..his strength
and power.  We turned him into a simperin sot..then raped his form--we
reconstructed his own feast men and had them have their way with him as he
had planned for me.  This was no hazer.  A hazer we could have forgiven..a
hazer we could have helped and sent a construct in like me.  This thing was
a violater..a dreamer who probed into the dayside thru the nightside.  This
one should have been taken care of a long time ago...Lyn and I made sure he
got what he deserved..or so we kept tellin ourselves.</p>

<P>I took him back to the feastin ground that was now another open desert bit
of the Wild lands.  He was broken and fadin.  I knew I had one last thing
ta do ta him..I pulled his sword from him and ran him thru..That did it.
He popped outta existence.  He wouldn't come back.</p>

<P>Lyn had woken after the bit in the void and had started pacin.  Lyn wasn't
happy bout the sit. Even if it was what felt right.  All there was left ta
do was kill this form.  I couldn't shift outta it...I didn't want this in
my list of forms I tend ta buzz thru when I'm bored or restless.  I took
the violator's sword..now mine..and fell upon it, tempted take on a "Roman"
battle outfit.  Lyn laughed.. That was a good thing, I hoped..the form
died, and I rose a spirit.</p>

<P>Back to the Kitten..the inn not the Innkeeper.  One day I might tell him
and Ceridh of the violation, but I doubt it.  Something bad had
happened..and for now, perhaps, it was better kept to myself...</p>

<P>Lyn got the paper that mornin..donno why..guess it just felt like the
thing ta do..an attempt at growin up? Or a bit of normalcy? Though Lyn
buyin a paper wasn't too normal, if ya asked me.  There on the first
page..."Serial Killer Found Dead"...."Suspected killer was found dead last
night...Thomas Lowery was found dead in his apartment by his fianc&eacute;...'It
looked like he [Lowery] had gotten involved in the occult," Sgt Peter
Mannings of the closeted shrine Lowery had been found in..'He had pictures
of these naked fairy things with the heads of the people that had been
killed on top of ^&Ntilde;em' a source reported...'He always had a fascination
with that sort of thing; I just thought he was working on his book,' Marie
Rimbly speaking of her fianc&eacute; Lowery...&quot;</p>

<P>Lyn didn't read any more of the paper..not even the funnies.  We know that
we had stopped the beast; did it feel good to know that? Donno, does it
feel good to kill another livin creature, no matter what it's done or what
part you rationalize yourself havin played in that lil bit of justice?</p>

<p>No, I think tonight Ima Gene Notory will just keep outta da Wilds..cuz
right now I'm just not ready to face it.  Though I do like the way this
Xena outfit looks on me..mee-ow...</p>
