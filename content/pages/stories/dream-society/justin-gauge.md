## How I Learned Delusions Can Be Strictly Medicinal

## The Hospital Record

I've heard what the doctors had to say about my condition. I also know what they had to say, what little was said anyway, about my recovery. I just want to clear a few things up. I assume this record will be included in my medical history? Good.

To begin, just for the record, my name is Edward G. Hoff. I am 43 years old. Two months ago, according to the physicians that treated me, I was involved in a three-car accident which pushed my head through a windshield at roughly 60 miles per hour. I was on my way to visit my fiancee of a week in Edmonton. According to the police report, my body actually had to be forcibly removed from the wreckage. In short, I was written off as "only a matter of time".

They put my body in a hospital on life support. I was locked in a coma, and no amount of medication appeared to help. They say that you don't dream in a coma, can't dream in a coma. I guess these are the same people that believe that the mind is the brain, and there's no such thing as a soul. I wish I could convince them. Perhaps when I become a better dreamer I can find them and show them.

The first thing I remember is waking up on a desolate rock plain. There were three men and two women surrounding me, all wearing white robes. I asked them if I had gone to Heaven. One of the women laughed lightly and pointed a finger. "No.. Heaven is that way."

The next thing I remember, I was laying in a warm bed. I thought I was in some kind of hospital, until I saw those five angels hovering over me. "Who are you?" I managed. I could feel my whole body was broken. The same woman who had spoken earlier shushed me quietly. "You're in the Healing Halls of Principia. We found you in the Wilds. We're going to treat you.. make you better. What's your name?"

"Edward Hoff," I said.

"Is that your day name?" one of them asked.

I didn't know how to answer him, so I nodded yes.

"Well, Edward, my name is Alannah. You're going to be alright, if you let us help you," the first woman smiled. "Will you let us help you?"

I nodded, then it occurred to me. "What happened? This doesn't look like any Edmonton hospital."

"You're in a different kind of hospital now, Edward. We are here to take care of your mind, then your body. If you work with us, and let us help you, you can be back on your feet in a matter of months."

"I don't understand?"

"You will."

## The Treatment Begins

For the next week I rested in bed while the five angels gave me food and water, talked with me, played chess with me (a passion I had forgotten from my younger days, which they seemed to know about without asking me), read stories, asked me my opinion on certain simplistic-sounding moral and ethical situations, found out what I thought on politics and religion. I never once saw them administer drugs, never once check clipboards of medical information. They never acted like doctors or nurses, they acted like people who genuinely cared about me and wanted to see me better. At the end of the week, my body had never felt better, and I could think clearly. I kept trying to figure out on my own what exactly they had done, until one day Alannah visited me and asked me if I wanted to go outside into the sun.

"I don't understand all of this. How is it that I feel so miraculously cured? And how is all of this paid for? And why don't I see any medication anywhere?" I blurted out.

Alannah sighed and looked at me. "We've concentrated so much on restoring and strengthening your mind, just for this conversation. I hope you will understand what's happening here."

"You are not in a hospital as such. In fact, your body is not actually here. Before you ask, let me explain."

"Your physical body, as such, is in a hospital somewhere in Edmonton. Who you see yourself as now, your body if you will, and all of us, this place, is not the world you were in. Please understand and bear with us. You will receive as much evidence as you require to demonstrate what we say."

"Then where am I?" I asked, confusion slowly sublimating into a instinctive fear.

"You're in a place some call the Dreaming Society. We have always talked about the 'dream world'. Well... this is it. You're in the world of dreams. But it's much more real than you might think."

She gestured towards the table, which as far as I knew was empty. I glanced over, then turned my attention on it as I saw a glass of water. The glass was as real as anything around me. The water sparkled in the sun's light shining through the window. But it hadn't been there ten seconds ago. I was looking at the only door into the room I was in. Nobody had come through it.

"Drink it. See for yourself, it's real."

Very cautiously, I approached the table and picked up the glass. It nestled firmly in my grip. I brought the rim to my lips and tasted for a moment. It was water. Pure, crystal water, better than I'd ever had.

"How is this possible?"

"As I said," she smiled, "this is the world of dreams. Where our real world operates on the principle of physical laws, the dream world operates on the principles of symbolism. To you, a glass of water is a symbol of refreshing taste and natural energy. A small, airy sunlit room is a symbol to you, representing recovery and health, more than any sterile hospital room might. By placing these things around yourself, you are making it possible to be healed."

"But if this is only my mind, then nothing is happening with my body?"

"Once your mind has strengthened and you've received some training, you will actually be able to heal your own body. We will be with you, offering our energy. Within a matter of weeks, your physical body should be ready to leave the hospital."

"Then surely you exist in the real world as well? Who are you?"

Alannah smiled. "In real life, I am honestly nothing like you see here. If you could see me, alone in my wheelchair, you'd understand why."

"But you look so beautiful..so healthy!"

She grinned wryly at me. "You look pretty damn healthy too.. for a man in a coma."

Something in me just let go, and for the rest of the afternoon we simply talked and enjoyed the sunshine in the Healers' garden, in the country of Principia, in noplace in particular. Not once after that did I question my situation.

## The Convalescence

The next two weeks were spent exploring the Healers' enclave. I learned a lot just by visiting the various rooms. The Healers were a group of former medical practitioners, current physicians, mystics, general do-gooder, a couple of Peace Corps members, and more. They would search what are called the "Wilds" for people who were unconscious -- an impossible state in the dream world, unless you're comatose or severely hurt -- and brought them back to their facilities for treatment. If other dreamers notify the Healers of someone they know is injured in the "real world", the Healers will go find that person.

They have a curious set of customs in the dream world. One of the first that I had to learn was that "real names" are not encouraged. The symbolism that composes the dream world requires that we take on some sort of alter ego; otherwise you simply fall out of the world and back into normal, muddled dreaming (what they called the Wilds). It was one of the male Healers' suggestions, when he'd heard of my recent betrothal, suggested "Justin Gauge", a play on "just engaged". We all agreed it was a great name, and I devised what I considered to be a stereotypical wise-looking old man. With some practice, I was able to shift my form, and maintain it until it became second nature to me.

Another custom that I was to learn was that "day-side" business and life was, if not taboo, at least an uncomfortable topic of discussion with most dreamers. I was advised not to bring it up, unless it was brought up with someone I was talking to.

Alannah and I spent much time discussing the procedure for healing the body. I was simultaneously amazed at my apparent detachment from what until only a few weeks ago had been the only existence I had known, and surprised at myself for not realizing the dream world had existed before. I could feel myself becoming more and more of two minds about my situation. Alannah reassured me that this was normal. The dream-lives and the real lives, or as the dreamers said, nightside and dayside lives, were not intended to mix.

I became acclimatized to the Healers' grounds, then began my own first steps outside their walls, into the country of Principia.

## Explorations in the City

The day I set foot outside the Halls, I was amazed. It's all very well to see the pictures futurists devise, to see models and mockups, even to dream of what the world could be like. But to see it, here, as real as in the waking world, was something I had to take several minutes to adjust to. All around me, the great city of Ur-Giger rose. The buildings were an amalgam of futurist (or alien) aesthetic and solid, proto-Medieval construction. It brought home the existence of my situation, and invoked anew the nagging debate that had held my heart since I was told the nature of this world: is this not real simply by virtue of being a dream?

I am not a philosophical man by nature, but I confess that these thoughts engrossed me for most of my trip through the city, drawing me away from the fantastic buildings and sights that could have been mine that day out.

When I had asked for a map, the Healers had laughed. "You'll find out," one had explained, "that if you want to go somewhere in particular, you'll end up there at whatever speed comes naturally to you, and if you just want to browse, you'll tend to find whatever interests you anyway." His words came to mind as I stopped before a quaint gambrelled shop with a sign reading Philosophy by the Glassful.

The pub (for it turned out to be a pub) was well-lit, built on several levels, and consisted of a bar and several round tables. Most of the tables were populated by an eclectic assortment of people of all shapes, sizes, and descriptions, many heatedly arguing over topics I couldn't make sense of. Tending bar was an enormous, redheaded man wearing an immaculate apron. He struck me as Irish immediately, although I had no rational basis for making such a judgement.

Since this seemed to be the place I had been in search of, I approached the bar and decided to try the direct approach with this dream-world I had come into. "I could use some philosophy, friend. What can you offer me?"

The big man looked me up and down. "You look like the sort of man who's got a philosophy scattered on his workbench already, and you just need the right words to put it together," he smiled.

"You're probably right.. what kind of place is this?"

"Well..that's hard to say. The place is almost always filled with writers, poets, people who tend to get paid for dreaming," he winked. "If you've found your way here, you either need some advice from myself or one of these fine gentlemen, or you're the sort of person who would be a welcome addition to the regular crowd."

"I imagine I'm the former. I'm a newcomer to this dream world.. I suppose I'm still coming to terms with it. What's the best way to adjust?"

"Everybody has their own ways of adjusting to it. But I think everybody goes through the same basic realization: there's no fundamental reason that dayside is real and this is unreal. I heard an interesting theory one time. Some scientists decided that to be called alive, you had to do six things: consume, grow, reproduce, move, and a couple things I can't remember. Well, some smart fella came along and proved that fire does the same thing. Is fire alive? I think it just goes to show you that what a fella gets paid a lot of money to say isn't always what's right. If a psychologist came in here and told me this was all a delusion, I'd ask him how he knew dayside wasn't."

"So this place is just as real as the real world?"

"We call it dayside around here, but yeah, it's just as real. Only the laws of physics work differently."

"Thanks.. don't think I caught the name?"

"Mike Callahan."

"Thanks."

## The Recovery

I spent the sunlit time (having learned to avoid calling it "day") exploring Ur-Giger and the cities around it, taking exhilarating horserides through grassy fields and apple orchards. I'd never ridden a horse in the real world, but after that experience I think I shall have to try it.

Principia is a dream-nation, one of several as I understand it, and one that borders most closely on the Wilds. The geography of the dream-world was explained to me once. Something called "the Committee" was founded a century or two ago to make sure that the world behaved in a reasonably coherent fashion. If you dream up or obtain a compass, for example, it'll point north, because the Committee laid down a particular direction that would be north, and people who enjoy navigating by compass can now use them with some assurance of accuracy. The dream-nations can be thought of as sitting at the core of a massive continent, with the Wilds on most sides. Principia is one of the westernmost nations.

Another interesting datum that really shook me up was that Heaven, or something answering the description of Heaven, is actually reachable by travel from the dream-world. Other "spiritual planes" have also been described and noted. It is considered taboo to attempt entry into these places unless you have actually died, and I have heard no stories of anybody who succeeded and returned. These things have burdened my mind since my recovery, and I feel that I have aged twenty years in wisdom through my experiences.

After my excursions into city and countryside, I would return to the Healers' Hall to meditate on these things and to continue my training in what can only be called psychic healing. The theory was explained to me as part of the training.

The mind and body are intimately connected, even during periods of unconsciousness. A dreaming mind can return to its body at any time, and as long as there are dreamers ready to catch the mind, it can return to the dream-world again. The Healers would infuse my mind with healing energy, a process even they had some difficulty explaining to me. My own comprehension of it was not required for the success of the ritual and so I let it pass.

Once the training was complete, my trips outside the Hall ended. In the morning, myself and the Healers working with me would meditate on the purpose of the healing, and the way it would be accomplished. They would form a circle around me, touching hands, and I could feel energy flowing into my body -- or mind, depending on your perspective. Then, with their encouragement, I would leave the dream-world, "sinking" my mind back into my physical body. I would feel the healing energy leave me, then a "pull" as they drew me back. By the time I returned, the sun outside had set. The process was disorienting as far as time is concerned; I felt like I was operating at a different speed than the dream-world around me.

On the last day, the Healers announced that I would be able to recover normally. I stood, symbolic suitcase and hospital discharge papers in hand, for I was ready to leave this place of healing for the last time. Alannah came to see me after I had said my fond goodbyes to the other healers. "I just wanted to wish you all the best," she smiled, and kissed me on the cheek. "If you choose to return to the Society, I hope you will come here again and visit us."

"I would love to.. I can't tell you how much you all mean to me, you have given me my life."

"You gave your life back to yourself.. we only helped. Thank you for letting us help you."

I gave her a hug goodbye, picked up my suitcase, and walked out of my room, down the hallway, and out the door into the sunlight...

## The Return

I could feel the sunlight on my face. It was terribly bright, and I brought one arm up to shield my face. It felt a little sore, but quite normal. I could feel the sensation of an IV needle in my arm with adhesive patches over it, and looked around.

I heard some kind of machine beeping. A nurse who was passing by the doorway glanced into the room, stopped, rushed in, looked at me a little stupidly, and ran out calling for the doctor. That worthy quickly rushed into the room followed closely by the nurse.

"Mr. Hoff.... can you hear me?"

"Quite well, yes, thank you," I replied.

"Do you know what happened?"

"Yes, I got into a car wreck and was in a coma. That was just about two months ago, was it not?"

The doctor nodded, mutely; he wasn't used to comatose patients telling him just how long they'd been "dead to the world".

I smiled, "Well, as soon as you pronounce me fit, I'd be very much interested in leaving. Please facilitate this at your earliest convenience."

"Mr. Hoff, I'll be frank. When you came in here, there was a good suspicion that you were going to be .. for lack of a better term, a vegetable, for the rest of your life. Your body was on artificial life support. Frankly, we didn't think you had a chance in hell."

"Doctor, I've learned that not everything we're told is right. Have faith in things outside the waking world."

The examination was a culminating series of exclamations and repeated tests, as the doctors doing the testing were consistently surprised and sometimes unnerved by what they saw as a miracle.

I found my fiancee waiting in the reception area; thankfully, somebody had the presence of mind to call her and let her know I'd recovered. We both rushed into an embrace. Tears were falling down her face as she greeted me and told me she'd been praying for me every night. I wanted to tell her all about the dream world I'd been in, but I thought that if I were to tell her, it should be at a better time. I let it pass with, "well.. I almost saw Heaven, but I'm back now."

So, gentlemen. You've heard my statement, and obviously you'll pass some kind of judgement on it. I don't expect you to believe what I have to say. But I hope that you'll at least be willing to see that there is more to life than drugs and chemicals and the waking world that so many of us embrace even as it crushes our spirits. I don't know why or when hope and miracles and belief in more than we can see with our eyes became outlawed, but I'm sorry to see that less people believe in them.
