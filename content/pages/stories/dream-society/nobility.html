<p>- - - - -------------- <b>The Great Airship</b></p>

<p>In the arc of the heavens above what most people consider the Dreaming
Society, there are clouds, birds, sunshine, and night.  There is also something
larger than most people care to consider, something as large as some of the
cities on the supercontinent below.  It is a vast airship levitated by the
wills of those onboard, and inhabited by a people the Dreaming Society calls
&quot;the nobility of the air&quot;.</p>

<p>Though the highest authority that the Dreaming Society bows to is the
Committee, the nobility of the air nonetheless spend their days playing at
royalty, dancing, affecting fine jewelry and well-made costumes, living within
their dream within a dream.  It is a timeless formality, rife with secret
scandal and bright smiles.</p>

<p>It was out of this world that Clea fled, evading the renegade Warlocks that
guarded the airship and its inhabitants.  She wished herself gone, and the
Dreaming Society swallowed her up and would not reveal her to those who
followed in search of her.</p>

<p>- - - - -------------- <b>The Drifter</b></p>

<p>Malloy sat up a little bit and in the process dislodged the headphones of
his Walkman from his ears.  The glint of sunlight reflecting off the tinted
glass of the bus windows made him blink a few times and block his eyes with
his hands.  He stared out at the flat desert rolling past at high speed.  The
horizon laid a spell of enchantment on him as he looked north.  In his mind
over and over he could see the girl, pixie face framed in golden locks, the
desperate cry for help, a city in Californa -- and that was all he could
remember.  He knew where he was going.</p>

<p>Malloy has always been a mystic and a dreamer.  Six weeks ago he was cuddled
beneath an overpass in Atlanta, drunk out of his mind.  The dreams began then,
a beautiful girl begging for help.  There was a startling amount of reality
and detail to her, and what she said made sense.  Even in his stupor, Malloy
had felt the tug of destiny.</p>

<p>He had thrown the bottle away and used the last of his money to buy a bus
ticket to California.  He had only his backpack and a few clothes to take with
him.  Even now as he sat on the Greyhound watching the world go by, he couldn't
get her face out of his mind.  It was more than a dream, he felt.  Although he
had no words to describe this new experience, he could identify the feelings it
provoked within him.</p>

<p><i>She's beautiful,</i> he thought to himself.  <i>I don't know how, but I
know she's for real.</i>  This same train of thought had seized his mind since
the time he'd been preparing to travel.  Try as he might to get uninterrupted
sleep, the image of her face and the sound of her voice returned to haunt him.
Sometimes he felt as though it were a new summons; sometimes he thought it was
only the memories of earlier dreams.</p>

<p>Malloy drew off the headphones and set them in the seat next to him.  He
withdrew an apple from his backpack and polished it absently, still distracted
by the terrain outside the fast-moving universe of the Greyhound.  He took a
bite and felt a perverse sense of gratitude at the feeling of the juice
dripping from his lips.  It was a new and subtly horrific sensation, feeling
as though reality is slipping through your fingers and leaving you in a cold
and uncertain darkness.</p>

<p>He was always a creature of two worlds.  Even when he was young he had
dreams of being a robot or a starship pilot or an explorer of the dark corners
of the globe.  This experience was something new.  It was the falling away of
both worlds, the banal real world that sustained him and the glamorous dream
life that nourished him.  It made him nervous, for his grip on either plane had
never been the best, and now he felt trapped.  The only act he was now capable
of was plunging into the heart of his darkness, praying there was something
he could hold onto beyond it.</p>

<p>His reverie carried him through the state of New Mexico, an uneaten apple
resting loosely in his hand.</p>

<p>- - - - -------------- <b>California</b></p>

<p>The hot summer sun beat down on Malloy as he stepped off the bus.  He spied
a trashcan nearby.  With a quick gesture he flung the aging applecore into it
and turned to collect his suitcase from the luggage area.  The driver was
pulling bags and suitcases from within the storage compartment; Malloy spotted
his and moved to intercept it.  The driver looked up and held out a hand.
&quot;You can collect your bags inside.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sort of in a rush,&quot; replied Malloy, reaching out for the
suitcase.</p>

<p>The driver stood up.  Within him, Malloy could feel the indomitable spirit
beating again.  Even with his solipsism, the thing he called the Will of Iron
rose.  He could hear the shift in his voice.  &quot;I'll take my suitcase
now.&quot;</p>

<p>The driver looked up.  There was a strange look in his eyes as he mutely
withdrew his hand from Malloy's suitcase, which was promptly taken up.
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Malloy offered, and hurried into the terminal,
unspeakable fear gripping his heart.</p>

<p>Inside the bus office the rush of unreality came to an abrupt halt.  Here
he was, Petaluma, California.  Even from here he could detect the sound of
the nearby river flowing.  It was all here, all in color and real, everything
spread out before him like a panorama.  The dream-sense fled into the darkness
of his thoughts as he let the town engulf his senses.</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me, sir.&quot;  The words rang through his consciousness like
a cloister bell.  Malloy regained himself, turned.  &quot;Sir?&quot;  It was
the bus driver.  &quot;Yes.. what can I do for you?&quot; Malloy asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I just wanted to say, I hope you enjoyed your trip on Greyhound.
I.. I don't mean to disturb you.. just.. &quot; the driver managed, his eyes
still reflecting the fear and respect Malloy had come to associate with his
gift/curse, his Will of Iron.  Malloy nodded mutely and the driver returned to
the attendance of his other passengers.</p>

<p>He turned his gaze again to the distant horizon, feeling the rush of wind
across his cheek, and dreamed.</p>

<p>- - - - -------------- <b>The City on the Edge of Dreams</b></p>

<p>The drifter stood in the wagon hitch at the end of Petaluma Boulevard,
silently watching the people go by.  Clea watched him from her window for
a moment longer, then drew the shades.  <i>Can it really be him?</i> she
asked herself.  <i>I don't even know his name, but I feel drawn to this man.
And yet..</i></p>

<p>The young woman lapsed into mental silence, turning to regard the mirror
in front of her.  Blonde hair framed a pixie face, cleverly-applied makeup
concealing the lines where tears had flowed earlier.  The bruises around her
neck and collarbone were no longer visible when she removed the handkerchief
to inspect them, so she put it back into her pocket.  She wiped her eyes a
few more times, carefully avoiding the concealing makeup, and drew her hair
back into a ponytail.  She absently pulled the black scrunchy from her wrist
with one hand and used it to keep her hair pulled back.  She took one more
appraising look at herself in the bathroom mirror, then walked quickly out
of the tiny room.</p>

<p>Her heart was still racing; the shock of seeing someone so close in form to 
the man she had dreamed of still possessed her.  He looked like a vagabond,
and yet she had felt such a spark of nobility when she'd sought him out in the
Wilds of her dreams.  That he had actually felt her message deeply enough, and
had been willing to come here at all, confirmed her faith in her unknown
savior, and at the same time summoned all her doubts to the surface.</p>

<p><i>What if he's not the one?</i> she thought to herself as she continued
moving around the small garret cleaning up after herself.  <i>What if he's just
some guy on the street and doesn't recognize me?</i>  She threw her dirty
clothes onto the small bed in the corner, mentally promising herself to do
laundry later.  &quot;What if... .OOOOOH!&quot; she exclaimed in frustration
out loud to no one in particular.</p>

<p>She hurried down the stairs and ran across the boulevard to the Lapidary
Center, silently praying her lunch hour wasn't over yet.</p>

<p>- - - - -------------- <b>The Riverboat</b></p>

<p>The gangplank felt solid underfoot, but Malloy was still cautious.  He
carefully edged his way onto the enormous riverboat.  It had been pointed
out as one of the best attractions in Petaloma.  He could see why.</p>

<p>The riverboat was an exacting and painstaking replica of the old
Mississippi boats.  It was used for excursions, running on a daily schedule,
and Malloy felt a deep-seated desire to ride it.  There was a romanticism
about riding a riverboat, and whatever else his purpose in coming to this
small but beautiful town, he felt it couldn't hurt.</p>

<p>Much of the romanticism had fallen away when it came time for him to board.
The gangplank looked slippery; the railings on the deck looked fragile; the
river loomed forbiddingly.  Nonetheless, Malloy managed to get onboard.  He
could feel the silent trembling of the deck under his feet.  The distant throb
of the engine carried him forward to the bow of the boat.</p>

<p>Clea leaned against the forward rail of the upper deck and let the wind
toy with her hair.  Though she had only been living in Petaluma for a few
weeks, the urge to ride the riverboat hadn't been felt until today.  She could
see the sparkling Petaluma River spread out before you.  The expanse of the
surrounding land merged with the dome of the heavens above.  Clouds chased each
other lazily through the ocean of air overhead, spurred on by the wind that
caressed her face and whispered promises of salvation.</p>

<p>She turned, and suddenly he was there staring back at her with his blue
eyes, blue as the sky through which the fishers wheel and caw, flickering
with an unknown presence.  The expression on his face was subtly terrible, as
though some great daemon lay chained within him...</p>

<p>Clea let out a gasp of surprise and drew back against the rail.  Malloy
looked at her for several long moments.  &quot;I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
startle you.  Please, what's your name?&quot;</p>

<p>Clea took several deep breaths and let go of the deck rail.  &quot;Clea,
or Cleopatra is what my mother calls me.  It's you, isn't it.&quot;</p>

<p>Malloy smiled, looking out at the sky beyond Clea's shoulder for a moment.
His eyes unfocused for a moment before regarding her once again.
&quot;I guess it is.  Can we go talk somewhere?&quot;</p>

<p>- - - - -------------- <b>The Bar</b></p>

<p>Malloy set his beer down.  &quot;You know, I'm still having a serious
problem with all of this.  Let me see if I have this straight..&quot;</p>

<p>He locked gazes with Clea across the table, a bad rendition of &quot;Black
Dog&quot; raging in the background.  &quot;You mean to say.. if I understand..
that there's some kind of alternate reality out there, some strange parallel
Star Trek universe or whatever, that's made up of dreams... and you're in
danger there.&quot;</p>

<p>Clea nodded slowly.  &quot;Look, I know it sounds strange.  But it's true.
How else do you explain your presence here?&quot;</p>

<p>Malloy said nothing, but brought the bottle back to his lips and drank
deeply.  He remained quietly thoughtful until Clea nudged him across the
table.  &quot;Please.. have faith in me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would like to,&quot; Malloy responded, troubled.  &quot;But you
must admit, it is a fantastic story.&quot;</p>

<p>They both sat in silence, the noises of the bar troubling either very
little.  At length Clea spoke.  &quot;You know, the only reason you have
trouble accepting what I say is your logic.  You've been raised not to believe
in such silly nonsense as dream-worlds.  Am I right?&quot;  Malloy nodded
his muddled assent to this, and she picked up.</p>

<p>&quot;Then what's to stop you from believing in it logically?  I'm either
telling you the truth or I'm not, right?  And if I'm not, then either I
believe what I say or I don't.  You don't have any money, no family that I'm 
aware of, so it seems unlikely that I'm trying to take advantage of you.
So that means either I'm right, or I'm crazy, because I believe in what I'm
saying with all my heart.  So it's up to you to decide what I am.&quot;</p>

<p>Malloy reclined in his chair a bit and took another pull on the bottle.
He stared off into space for several long moments.  Finally he turned his
attention back to Clea.  &quot;Show me,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>- - - - -------------- <b>The Dream</b></p>

<p>Malloy could feel the rush of doubt gripping his heart.  <i>None of this
seems real,</i> he thought to himself, half wildly.  Something had seized his
limbs as he'd reclined on the bed, and although the impulse to flee came over
him in waves, he found he couldn't move.</p>

<p>Clea seemed to sense his tension as she sat on the edge of the bed.  She
laid a warm hand on his forehead and murmured, &quot;Just relax.&quot;  The
effect was almost mystical.  Malloy could feel his terror fading away with the
soft touch of her fingertips.  He gazed up at her and felt a relaxing golden
sensation easing its way into every cell of his body.</p>

<p>&quot;Close your eyes,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;Let yourself go.. and
dream.  I will be there with you.&quot;</p>

<p>The inner luminescence spreading out from his forehead became the only
sensation he could feel, and slowly he felt himself slipping away from all
that he was.  It was sleep, plain ordinary sleep, but it was the first rest
he'd gotten in years.</p>

<p>The self-absence of sleep faded into a misty blackness, and Malloy felt
the reassuring weight of identity once again.  But where was this?  He opened
his eyes.</p>

<p>Around him, a surreal landscape unfolded.  He was standing on the deck of
the riverboat.  But in the place of Petaluma, the giant craft meandered through
a river of clouds.  Malloy gripped the railing and fought back against a wave
of dizziness as he looked down into an infinitely-deep abyss of blue sky that
eventually faded to black.  The same was true in every direction he looked.
A voice shook him.</p>

<p>&quot;It's me,&quot; Clea said from behind him.  He whirled to see her there
behind him, gazing out across the eternal skyscape.  She wore a gossamer gown
that looked as though it had been spun of diamonds and dewdrops, and his heart
skipped a beat.  &quot;Is this it?&quot;</p>

<p>Clea nodded solemnly.  &quot;You're in a place called the Wilds; there's
nothing like this in the Dreaming Society proper.&quot;  She caught the look
of confusion on his face and explained.  &quot;Everyone who dreams, finds
themselves alone in their own little world at first, a place we call the Wilds.
The Wilds around a particular person is shaped the way that person normally
dreams.. this is the place where all dreams happen.  But you don't have to
stay in the Wilds.&quot;</p>

<p>With that she smiled and vaulted the railing of the riverboat with a grin
and vanished from sight.  Horrified, Malloy rushed to the edge of the deck and
stared down into the abyss.  He could see her dwindling figure, but it was
somehow changing.  He saw something coming up, and shrank back from the railing
just as a tremendous shape swooped past him -- upwards.</p>

<p>The looming bulk of a gossamer-looking dragon -- for dragon was the only
word that could describe this creature -- settled onto the second level of the
riverboat.  It extended a foreclaw, reaching all the way down to the first
deck as it leaned over its perch.  The reptilian face regarded Malloy, and it
spoke.  &quot;It's me, Clea.&quot;</p>

<p>Malloy remained riveted to the deck as the looming creature regarded him
with evident amusement.  &quot;You really don't believe it's me, do you?&quot;
it asked.  &quot;Well, I'm not going to bite, I promise you that.&quot;  The
voice was Clea's, with something else added, and Malloy managed to blink a
few times before clearing his throat.  &quot;Ok.. uhmm.... what now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said the dragon, &quot;you climb on my back and we fly
to the Society.&quot;  Malloy hesitated for a moment, then walked forward and
tentatively grasped the claw.  The dragon effortlessly hauled him onto its
back, a move that knocked the wind out of him.  &quot;Hold on tight,&quot; it
advised.  And it took off.</p>

<p>The sensation was indescribable.  Malloy had never ridden a rollercoaster
that he could remember, but he felt that if he'd ever had, this would feel
much the same.  Through the clouds they tore, into the inky blackness and
infinite cold of the night, and suddenly they burst through.  Malloy was
blinded by the daylight, the sun off to his left as the massive dragon
power-dived to the plain he could now see below.  Towns and villages were
visible now, speeding underwing and out of sight in the distance.</p>

<p>Another sharp dive and the great creature levelled out, finally choosing
a rocky outcropping to land on.  The shock of descent threw Malloy forward,
but he managed to keep his grip.  The draconian head turned backwards to view
him, offering a claw to ease his dismounting.  When he was free and clear, the
form of the dragon shifted wildly, and Clea stood before him, this time
wearing what looked like combat fatigues and a leather jacket.</p>

<p>&quot;That..... that was incredible,&quot; managed the drifter, still
gasping for air from the plummet.  Clea smiled back at him.  &quot;I need a
protector,&quot; she said, &quot;and for you to understand why, I want to
give you a demonstration.  Turning into a dragon means nothing when anybody
else can do it, or become bigger dragons.  The appearance of physical power and
strength here is meaningless.  But you have a gift that CAN make a difference
here.&quot;</p>

<p>Malloy looked on as she picked up an average-sized rock.  Suddenly she
sent it whistling past his head.  He ducked.  &quot;Hey.. be careful.  Even
in a dream I think that would hurt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It would.  But there's an indomitable part of you, the part that I
sensed before.  Stop me from throwing a rock, any way you can.&quot;</p>

<p>Malloy nodded, feeling inside himself for his will.  His eyes focused just
in time to see Clea drawing back.  He found himself shouting, &quot;Stop!&quot;
just as she was about to throw.  But the sound was different, magnified
somehow, and he could see an almost visible wave radiate from himself and sweep
through Clea.  As it touched her body she shook, and the rock vanished as
though it had never existed.</p>

<p>- - - - -------------- <b>Clea's Story</b></p>

<p>The two sat at a table in what was, as far as Malloy could tell, some sort
of tavern or inn.  &quot;So that's when they decided they wanted me, as some
sort of `prize' for their amusement.  At first I thought it would be great to
go live with them,&quot; Clea was saying, referring to some group she called
the Nobility of the Air.  &quot;After that, I found they didn't want to let me
go.  They would play their power games and their politics and their endless
genteel backstabbing.. and I got sick of being the trophy.  So I tried to
leave.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's when the Warlocks came.&quot;  Malloy heard a subtle shift in
her voice, one he knew from past experience of the voice of a woman who has
been raped in some fashion.  &quot;They serve the Nobles, every last one of
them.  They... toyed with my mind... perverted what was around me....&quot;
Clea's voice became muffled and she withdrew into herself for several moments.
Malloy sipped from his glass and gazed at her, a wash of compassion arresting
his attention.  At length she regained herself and continued.  &quot;So I
escaped.  I waited until they were all busy, and I jumped out of their
airship.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was afraid.. I was so terribly afraid I can't tell you.  But you
know how everyone talks about having dreams about falling, and they wake up
because they know it's only a dream?  Right at that moment, I remembered..
this IS a dream.  But I didn't wake up.  If I'd done that, the next time I
dreamed, I would be right back on their airship.  It's weird, I don't know
or understand it at all, but you get `anchored' to places in the Society, and
when you start dreaming again, you go back to those places.  I think it has
something to do with how many people are around.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But anyway.. I remembered it was a dream, and I thought, if I can be
anything in my dreams, why can't I be something that can fly?  So I tried, and
it worked.  I changed myself into a dragon, I guess because I really like
dragons.  And I flew down here, to Nandohar, which is where a lot of my friends
live.  And then I woke up, and did everything I could not to dream again.
That is, until you came.&quot;</p>

<p>Malloy absorbed all this in contemplative silence.  At last he took a
great draught from his mug and set it down carefully on the carved wooden
tabletop.  &quot;I'll do what you want me to do.  I don't know if I can come
to terms with this place, or what you say, but I'll try.&quot;</p>

<p>He caught her eye and locked gazes with her.  &quot;But I want you to
understand something,&quot; he said slowly and deliberately.  &quot;Whatever
this thing is, this Will of Iron, it has... side effects.  It twists people
into shapes I don't wish to think about.  It's not natural, and I don't intend
on using it any more than I find necessary.  Just...please, be careful?&quot;
his blue eyes, shining with a feeling she knew but dared not name.</p>

<p>Clea nodded mutely, and Malloy smiled grimly.  &quot;Looks like it's time
to find some folks and show them what happens when you mistreat a lady.&quot;
</p>

<p>- - - - -------------- <b>The Real World</b></p>

<p>Malloy woke and looked through the shafts of evening sun flooding the room
with their dying radiance.  Clea, curled up and still asleep on the couch,
was bathed in the glow.  For a brief moment Malloy could still see that dress
she'd worn in his dream, but his eyes refocused and he could see the reality
once again.</p>

<p>Several minutes later, Clea stirred.  The setting sun had disappeared beyond
the horizon.  Malloy looked up from his reverie and smiled.  &quot;I didn't
want to wake you up,&quot; he apologized.  &quot;You looked like you could
use a good nap.&quot;</p>

<p>Clea smiled wanly and struggled to sit up.  &quot;That riverboat in the
clouds, that was very beautiful you know,&quot; she smiled.  Malloy looked
stunned for a moment, but smiled in return.  &quot;I've already accepted the
reality of what I ... or I suppose I should say we ... experienced in there.
You....&quot;  He faltered for several moments and fell silent.</p>

<p>Clea smiled and rose gracefully from the sofa, taking a moment to stretch
out.  She moved into the kitchen, calling back, &quot;you want some coffee
or something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah... I want something.. &quot; the drifter mumbled half to
himself.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh.. yeah, coffee would be great, thanks.&quot;</p>

<p>She returned a few minutes later with two steaming cups of Instant.
&quot;There's cream in the cupboard if you want,&quot; she offered, as Malloy
gratefully received his mug.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks.. Look, you probably know.. I mean, I don't know how to bring
this up, but.. well, I just got into town and --&quot;</p>

<p>Clea stopped him with a gentle smile.  &quot;You're very welcome to stay
here tonight, and for as long as you want.  We can take turns on the sofa.
But I don't even know what you do?&quot;</p>

<p>Malloy smiled ruefully.  &quot;Well... I don't really do anything,
anymore... I, uh, I used to be a writer.. I did columns for newspapers, short
stories, that sort of thing.  I always had my head in the clouds, and I guess
I was always good with words.  My mother always said I should be a poet.  She
collected all the stupid poems I wrote when I was a kid, she'd read them to
the family and I'd be so embarrassed, I'd hide in my room the rest of the
day.  I won a writing contest in high school.  My teacher, Mr. Thornton,
sent the essay to the <i>Gazette</i>, and they actually published it.  After
that you couldn't get near my mother without her telling you the story about
how her boy got himself published.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's when IT happened, I think.  One day I just came home and I
looked at my mother and told her, don't ever read my poems again.  I could feel
something welling up inside me.  It was like Gospel truth, the power of it
was just flowing out of me.  I saw this look on my mother's face and she was
almost about to cry, she couldn't speak, but I KNEW, just looking at her
expression, that she wouldn't ever do it again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ran out of the house and I kept running and running, I was so scared
of what I'd just done.  I think I tripped and hit my head, because I woke up
underneath a tree in the park, probably a mile away from my house.  I got
back in the morning and pounded on the door until my dad let me in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I couldn't face my mother after that.  I tried to apologize, but she
didn't act like I'd done anything wrong.  She'd just keep looking at the floor
and whispering that she was sorry whenever I tried to talk about it.  I..&quot;
Malloy's voice broke, and Clea could see tears streaming down his face.
&quot;I.. I couldn't make it right.  I couldn't do anything to fix what the
damn thing inside me had done.  And I knew my mother would hurt until the end
of time.&quot; he looked up, his eyes shining with tears.  &quot;I'm such a
wordsmith, everyone says, but I can't put words to how I felt.&quot;</p>

<p>Clea felt her own tears forming, and quickly wiped them away.  She set her
coffeecup down and sat down on the bed next to the drifter, and tentatively
wrapped her arms around him.  &quot;I'm so sorry.. I had no idea.. I didn't
know what it meant to you to use it..&quot;</p>

<p>- - - - -------------- <b>The Hunted</b></p>

<p>The drifter started from a light doze at the frenzied tugging on his shirt.
He looked up and saw an angel through blurred eyes.  The sensation faded and he
found himself on the floor next to Clea, who was busy trying to rouse him.
&quot;He found me!&quot; she kept repeating, &quot;I don't know how but he found
me here.. we have to get out of here.&quot;</p>

<p>Malloy blinked briefly, then roused himself fully awake.  &quot;Alright,
I can find out who later.  Get your stuff.&quot; he directed, then moved quickly
and efficiently to his backpack on the floor.  It was packed up in seconds, and
he moved to organize Clea's scattered and meager belongings into the suitcase
she'd already half-packed on the bed.  Outside the door, steps could be heard
coming up from downstairs.  A feeling of panic welled up in his heart, but he
suppressed it savagely and looked around.  &quot;There's no fire escape, is
there?&quot;  Clea shook her head desperately.</p>

<p>Wasting no time, Malloy strode to one of the windows, leaning down midstride
to retrieve his backpack from the floor.  A quick appraisal showed that the
window wouldn't open far enough to allow exit by itself, so with a loud yell
he kicked out the entire frame.  He looked out.  The street below wasn't that
far -- nothing soft to land on, but he could lower himself down easily enough,
then catch Clea as she dropped.  A sudden banging on the door spurred him to
action.</p>

<p>&quot;Now let's move,&quot; he yelled, &quot;we're taking the back
door.&quot;  With that he hopped the windowsill and flailed ten feet down to
street level.  The shock of impact winded him, and he rolled for a moment in
the dust before regaining his feet.  Looking up, he caught sight of Clea
leaning hesitantly out the window.  &quot;Move!&quot; he shouted, and the girl
clambered over the windowsill as well and dropped into Malloy's waiting
arms.</p>

<p>The pair raced down the street and around the corner, luggage in hand.
&quot;Got a plan?&quot; panted the drifter.  Clea shook her head, &quot;No..
we just have to get out of this place.&quot;</p>

<p>The wave of dizziness almost brought Malloy to his knees as he felt
everything slip away from him again.  He staggered into an alley, stumbled
over several trashcans, and fell to his knees dry-heaving.  Clea ran up behind
him, discarding her suitcase and kneeling beside him.  &quot;What's
wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing...&quot; he panted.  &quot;Just.. a moment...&quot;  He wiped
his chin and mouth on a dirty jacket sleeve and stood up on wobbly legs.  He
glanced around and spotted an old brown Nova parked across the street from the
alleyway.  &quot;We've got a plan now,&quot; he muttered.</p>

<p>- - - - -------------- <b>The Road</b></p>

<p>&quot;So you're ok now?&quot; Clea asked above the sound of the engine.</p>

<p>Malloy looked away from the highway long enough to smile and nod.
&quot;Yeah.. everything's fine, I just sometimes have these weird spells.
It's really nothing to worry about.&quot;</p>

<p>Clea nodded uncertainly.  &quot;And where did you learn to hotwire a car?
Or do I even wanna know?&quot;</p>

<p>The drifter smiled, eyes on the road.  &quot;You don't want to
know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know,&quot; continued the girl, &quot;it does sort of surprise
me, now that I think about it.. I put so much trust in you, and I don't even
know your name.  I never asked.. I guess it doesn't even seem important, but
please please don't think .. that sounds really mean I guess, I apologize.
What is your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Malloy.. James Michael Malloy.&quot;</p>

<p>Clea smiled.  &quot;That's a nice name.  I'm Cleopatra Summer.  I just have
one of those funny names, I guess.  Always liked Clea, though.&quot;</p>

<p>Malloy had sunk into reverie as she talked, and told him about her family,
or what her family had been.  He was disturbed by the implicit trust between
them as well, although he dared not voice his own doubts.  He wasn't sure if
it was the implications of that trust that bothered him -- for hadn't he just
stolen a car in the defense of a woman he'd known something like 36 hours? --
but also that he could or would let himself trust completely enough to reveal
a part of his childhood that burned in him like a hot poker.  <i>Maybe it's
time for me to trust,</i> he reflected.  <i>Maybe this is my way of telling
myself, you've been alone too long bub.</i></p>

<p>Clea was silent for awhile.  Finally she turned to him.  &quot;That was
my foster-dad back there.  I'm nineteen years old, I'm legally an adult, but
that wasn't good enough for him.  When I tried to leave home he .. he hurt me,
and he kept me from going.  I got away from him, then I got away from the
Nobility.  I can't be a doll for someone's amusement..&quot;  With a shudder
she lapsed back into silence.  After several moments of inner turmoil, Malloy
laid a comforting hand on her shoulder and glanced over at her, smiling.
She looked back at him, tears forming in her eyes, and touched his hand with
hers.  &quot;You don't know what it means to me.. to have someone like you
watching out for me.&quot;  The drifter smiled, and in his heart he knew he
had a protector now as well.</p>

<p>- - - - -------------- <b>The Cafe'</b></p>

<p>The seed of courage, the spark of true determination that had been so long
absent from his life, was once again growing inside him.  With that courage
had come a plan.  He outlined it to Clea over coffee, in a small roadside
cafe' with the Nova parked offroad half a mile away.</p>

<p>The best defense is a good offense, said the old saying.  Malloy believed
this once again.  The way to deal with these problems, he reasoned, was to
resort to the most powerful force of authority in each place.  In the real
world, that was the justice system.  Clea would need to get a restraining
order against her foster-father, forcing him to stay away from her, invoking
the law if he failed to comply.  Against the forces arrayed in the Dreaming
Society, Malloy was more evasive, but it finally developed that he intended
to call upon the highest force for authority there as well: strength of will,
the ability to dominate the protean surroundings of the dreamworld.</p>

<p>Clea was at first horrified by the prospect of what on the surface sounded
like a direct confrontation, but Malloy reassured her that he could handle it.
&quot;No will has ever withstood me,&quot; he smiled with bitter pride.</p>

<p>In the end he left the decision up to her, and in the end she broke down
and agreed with him.  By nightfall, the pair had started travelling again.</p>

<p>- - - - -------------- <b>San Francisco</b></p>

<p>The drifter shielded his eyes from the bright summer sun as he watched Clea
hurry down the steps of the courthouse building and over to the car.</p>

<p>&quot;Ok.. it's done.  I got it.&quot; she exulted.  Malloy could see her
eyes shining.  <i>At last,</i> he thought, <i>she's feeling like she's able to
fight back.</i></p>

<p>- - - - -------------- <b>Nightfall</b></p>

<p>The fleeting stream of consciousness danced at the edge of his awareness.
The subtle nagging sensation dragged him from somnolence and restored his
sense of self.  The drifter felt himself resting oddly on the sofa in the
darkened hotel room.  The sensations which had awakened him couldn't be made
out consciously but he could still detect the undercurrent.  He opened his
eyes very slowly and scanned the room.</p>

<p>The shadows clung to the walls strangely.  Their lurking presence haunted
him.  He could almost feel his pupils dilating, taking in the darkness.  A
sudden shift of motion and Malloy was over the back of the couch and grappling
with a strange figure.  The intruder belted out a hoarse oath and struck
Malloy hard at the shoulderblade, then attempted to dart out of his grasp.</p>

<p>- - - - -------------- <b>(more to come)</b></p>

<p>He gripped her by the shoulders, holding her gaze with his own, and she
could see his blue eyes, the color of ocean, deep and eternal and immortally
invincible.  &quot;Every human being stands upon the precipice of
greatness,&quot; he said.  &quot;We can back away and be nothing, or we can
stare into the great abyss of choice and not be afraid.  You must look the
universe in the eye.  The only power they have is what you give them.  Brave
the abyss and choose what you will.&quot;</p>
