# The Search

Winston leaned up against the tree, staring up through the thick canopy to the stars above, and sighed. The fire, earlier burning brightly, had dwindled down to a few glowing embers. Winston added a few more tree branches, stoked the coals a little bit, and returned to examining the makeshift splint on his broken left leg.

*The stars are beautiful tonight,* he mused, flinching a moment as the pain of his leg shot through battered nerves. He picked up the weatherworn leather book resting at the top of his knapsack, settled himself against the tree and pulled his coat further around his shoulders. He brought a pen out of one coat pocket and tapped it to his lips thoughtfully for a few minutes.

*It has been two days since the accident, and no sign of rescue yet. I estimate I have five days of food left, if I'm conservative. Water, however, may prove to be more of a difficulty. I can hear a stream in the distance, but I can't make out a direction, and even if I could I doubt I'm in any position to make it that far.*

*Although I convinced myself that telling Dad about this trip would have been a bad idea, I realize that I should have said something, even if I didn't ask his approval. Now because of my own stubbornness, I'm out in the wilderness with a broken leg and only my journal to keep me company. Serves me right... I just hope, somehow, that Dad will realize where I went and send a search party after me.*

*I don't feel totally stupid. I overpacked on food and water as best I could, I brought a radio, flare gun, first-aid kit, rope, everything. I've been hiking since I was twelve, I'm not unprepared.. I just never expected this to happen.*

The cool night air washed across the old Indian's face as he stirred the fire. He sat cross-legged at the edge of a bluff overlooking a quiet river. The dark waters streaming past reflected the steady flickering of the campfire, and the distant stars overhead. The man's Klickitat features narrowed in a brief moment of concentration, and with a gesture he withdrew a handful of herbs from a pouch at his waist and flung them into the fire.

Across the fire, the faces of his family looked back at the old man. "I know it's late, " he said. "but there is someone who needs our help, and tonight we go back into the Spirit Place."

Each of the figures seated around the fire leaned forward to inhale deeply of the smoke. Then, one by one, they sat back. Their eyes closed. Behind them, the river continued its quiet course, running into the starry night.

"Please, Sheriff, I understand... yes, I understand that too. I know it's late... Yes.... Yes, I know, but it's about my son Winston." The white-haired man cradled the telephone in his shoulder while his hands went about the unconscious motions of mixing his tea. He set the saucer down and took a shaky sip from the cup, almost spilling some. "Look, Winston's best friend is here, he told me my son went out hiking two days ago and was supposed to be here yesterday. Today was his graduation. My son is graduating summa cum laude, and he wasn't here for it. Sheriff, hang on! I know you are tired, but my son may be lost in those woods, and we need to find him."

The old man paced tensely back and forth in front of the expanse of the drawing-room window. "Please, Sheriff, just a few men.. no, I don't think it can wait until morning. You know who pays your taxes -- I do. I want something done, and right now." The young man sitting on the divan lowered his eyes and continued to focus on his hands.

Mr. Cohen hung up the phone and resumed his nervous circuit of the room. "You know Winston well, Tommy.. why would he do something like this?" The young man looked up from his hands, just enough to let Mr. Cohen know he was listening, but not daring to look the older man in the face.

"Well.. sir.. " began Tommy, "honestly I'm not sure what to say. The last time I saw him, all he did was tell me he was going hiking up in the hills, by Arcadia Park, then he drove off. I know he said he'd be back for graduation -- you know how important that was to him..sir."

Cohen nodded. "Thank you, Tommy. Why don't you go home, get some sleep, and I'll call your father when I find out something."

Tommy nodded and stood up. "I'm sorry, Mr. Cohen.. I wish there was something more I could do.. "

Cohen gripped the young man's hand firmly and smiled. "Winston is lucky to have such concerned friends as you." Tommy smiled, gathered his coat, and walked out the hall and into the night. Cohen watched him go, then dimmed the hallway lights. His face was a mask of frustration, anxiety, and anger as he walked upstairs.

Winston prodded the dying embers of the fire and bit into the cold salami. He washed it down with the last of his coffee and regarded the rising sun. He could feel every muscle and bone ache from the discomfort of sleeping against a tree, but he didn't know any other way to keep his leg immobile.

*Of all the things I could have packed, my cell phone was the most obvious thing, and I completely forgot it. I'm starting to wonder if what Tommy says is true -- if I'm so stuck on nature and keeping the Earth green that I don't stop to think about anything else. I guess I tried so hard to run away from it all that I ran too far.*

*I don't know if I can ever tell Dad how I really feel about him and his business. I know I should, Tommy tells me I should, but it feels like every time I want to talk to him he just brushes me aside and starts talking about what he wants for me now that I'm out of college. I can't believe I'm missing my graduation. I was supposed to give the friggin' speech, and I blew it. I'm never going to be able to talk to him now.*

*I'm afraid of going home. I'm afraid of what Dad's going to say. " You were out in the woods, while your classmates were celebrating their lives and jobs", he'll say. He'll tell me I need to get this nature stuff out of my blood. He'll blame my mother, like he was ever there for her. It's not fair! It's just not fair, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.*

*Just because he owns a bunch of sawmills, he acts like I'm supposed to not care if trees get cut down. "It's how I paid for all of this, it's how I got you into school". That doesn't mean anything! Doesn't he understand, there's more to life than money and school and work?*

*I guess I'm thinking about all this nature stuff too hard. I had a dream last night, a dream where a bunch of Klickitats came to me and took me through the wilderness into a city. They asked me where I was, but I didn't know, so they sent me back out into the wilderness.. or desert.. or something. I don't know where it was, it just seemed so utterly empty. I hope I'm not losing my mind.*

Winston closed the journal and surveyed his makeshift camp. There was nothing else for him to do but wait, watch, and pray.

The old man opened the cabin door and looked out. The rising sun peaked over the mountains to the east, shining down into the valley where he and his family lived. Removing an ancient, gnarled walking stick from its place behind the cabin door, the old man made his way out to the dirt road running parallel to the rushing river, where a beat-up Jeep idled.

"Dad," the man at the wheel asked, "why are we going all the way down to Arcadia Park?". The old man wheezed getting into the Jeep. He closed the door and turned, giving his son a toothful grin. "To show you why it's so important to believe in the Spirit Place. Now drive."

A few minutes later and a few miles away, the younger man turned briefly from his driving. "You know, the Sheriff is gonna come up one of these days and bust you. The only reason I go in for these crazy drug rituals of yours is because you're my dad, and I'm supposed to honor you. But when they arrest you and throw you in the white man's jail, you know who you'll have to thank for it, don't you?"

The old man smiled. "The Spirit Place is not a vision of drugs. It is a place where we can go when we dream. You know what? I talked to a man who came here, that I met in the Spirit Place, and he told me that the white man know about it too."

"You mean that fruitcake from the University? You actually listened to that guy?"

"White man is not stupid, my son. They have traditions as old as we do, and some of theirs are older. For as long as people have roamed this world, this man said, they've also been part of the other place, the spirit world, the Spirit Place. He calls it Dreaming Society, but it is all the same, whatever name you give to it."

"Sure. So this 'lost kid' you want to find, what, he met you in a dream and told you 'Hey, old Indian dude, find me'?" the younger man snorted. He turned the wheel sharply to avoid ruts in the road, and skidded onto pavement, turning onto the highway.

"No, he did not come to me. In the Spirit Forest, the animals of the Place came to him, and it was they who told me of his plight. This boy is a part of the land, they said, and he must be helped. It is important, for the land and for everyone in it, that he be saved."

"Dad.. no matter what happens, I'll go along with what you want me to do, because I care about you. But please don't ask me to believe any of this stuff, ok?"

The old man smiled. "You will see, and when you do, believe or do not believe. But do not judge until you are sure."

The Jeep continued down the highway, towards the mountains.

Sheriff Biggs adjusted his jacket, trying unsuccessfully to fend off the biting wind coming through the gorge. He walked from his car towards the abandoned Laredo. The two Indian men stood beside it, along with a uniformed officer, watching him.

"Deputy," he asked the officer, "these are the two men that reported finding the car?"

"Yessir. Said they'd come down for some fishing."

Biggs glanced sidelong at the two Klickitats. "You fellas sure did come a long way for some fishin', with out-of-state plates and all. Is there maybe somethin' you're not telling me?"

The old man started to speak, as his son looked on in consternation. "Sheriff, we both know there's a young man lost up in the woods. We are here to do what we can to find him, as you are."

The Sheriff thought for a moment. "Well, I suppose I can't force you to tell me just how you knew that Cohen kid was reported missing, unless you kidnapped him."

"We have no love for Robert Cohen," the old man spoke, "but nor do we have any reason to take his son. Nothing will persuade that man to stop what he's done to the forests except his own heart."

He looked again at the two men and their battered Jeep. "Well.. you two don't look like the kidnappin' type. And if you're going to be helping search, we'll be able to keep our eyes on you. Ok, let's figure out a plan of action."

Winston was sure he was dreaming, but in a way it was different. There were people there; two in the firelight of his camp, and more in the shadows of the trees beyond. Curiously, the terrain was very different, but he still intuitively knew that he was at his campsite. He found he could stand up, without a trace of pain in the leg he thought broken.

The old man, his face smiling and browned from the sun, was dressed in strange garb. The younger man with him was dressed in jeans and a flannel shirt as Winston was. The old man was saying something, something about a haze. Winston tried to make out the words, but it conveyed itself as feelings. He knew by feel that the old man wanted to protect and help him, and that he was an important figure in these woods.

Suddenly the old man came around the fire and looked Winston in the eye. His speech was clear, understandable, and infinitely disturbing in its portent. "We know you are lost, young man," the old Indian said. "We are looking for you now. If you have a radio, tune it to 1340 AM."

"It's important that we know where to find you. This is a dream, so you can change it. Make this place we are in look like where you are. See it in your heart, and so it will be."

Winston nodded mutely and looked around. He felt the surrounding forest changing, heard the hollow roar of the nearby waterfall. The land around him somehow shifted, rolling and moving beneath his feet. Gradually the dream-place took on the appearance of his campsite.

The younger Indian moved forward out of the fog and into clarity. "I know where this is, dad.. it's near the waterfall, downstream from Trapper Ridge. We can get there in a few hours if we go up the hill a little in the jeep." The old man turned a little to nod his approval, then returned his gaze to Winston. "We'll be there soon."

Winston nodded, and faded back into the mists as the old man withdrew from the Spirit Place. The desolate surroundings of the dream wilderness faded too as the old Indian surrendered from sleep and returned to the waking world.

----

They found Winston leaned up against a tree, still asleep. The sheriff to this day has never figured out how the two Klickitats found young Winston Cohen. He doesn't like to talk about it, but if pressed he'll mutter some apologetic comment about "damn Indian tracking mumbo-jumbo".

Winston Cohen and his father met in a tearful embrace at the hospital. In the years since, Robert Cohen has continued his business in logging. However, his business practice changed radically one day, after having a dream involving his son and two Indians. Everybody around him noticed the change. Some thought he'd seen a ghost, and to this day he won't reveal what happened. Cohen Lumbermills became one of the most noted philanthropic lumber companies in the Pacific Northwest, spending much of its budget and surplus capital on long-term reforestation plans, and supporting lobbying to encourage other companies to do the same.

Winston and his father enjoy a happy relationship to this day. He found work as an environmental-impact researcher and eco-scientist, doing work for Cohen Lumbermills and other companies, finding ways to get the most yield out of the forests while still putting back as much as possible.

And although nobody considers it very important at first, a young man living across the river became the shaman of his tribe, allowing his father to retire and take up storytelling and pipe-smoking as a profession. The young shaman tells the children of his town, and people who come to visit, about an other-world he calls the Spirit Place. And every year, a few people leave the little town by the river forever changed.
