<title>The Yellow House</title>

<P>My boss called me in today, said I wasn't &quot;performing up to standards&quot;, said I needed to re-evaluate my career and if I was really &quot;into&quot; this company. That bastard! Like I haven't slaved away for him, making him money and all that for the last 17 years.  I told him that sales were down all over and that it was just a market trend, but he just gave me that look of his. God, I hate him.</P>

<P>Had a really weird dream last night. It was even more strange because I don't usually remember my dreams and they aren't ever that vivid.  There was this yellow house, I mean, really yellow. Bright yellow. And big. Almost like an old Victorian mansion or something.  Well, anyway, I walked up to the house, somehow thinking it was mine, like I owned it, and walked inside.  It was really run down, like no one had lived there in years. Cobwebs everywhere. Broken staircases, holes in the floor. And while exploring the many rooms, I found a secret door of some sort. Something that no one, even if they ever came there would ever find. I entered and found a little bare room. Dust covered the floor, the walls were bare and all the windows were boarded up. An apple crate sat in the middle of the room, the only thing  in it, and on it was a stub of a candle, providing light.</P>
<P>The weird thing was; that even though a derelict, a pathetic refuse of a human being who tries to wash my Jag's windows for change wouldn't live here, it was my home. I felt comfortable. Safe.</P>

<P>That god-damned prick! That self-serving bastard of a know-nothing asshole! He FIRED me today. Said I wasn't on the cutting edge and some bullshit about &quot;creative salesmanship&quot;!  Now what the hell do I do?  Susan isn't working, I just lost my job and all the marketing jobs are going to the freaking &quot;young upstarts&quot;.  My life is over.  How the hell am I going to make my car payments, let alone these payments on the condo, being the goddamned manager of a freaking fast-food franchise or something?  What do I do?  Susan says she'll start teaching again, but it's not enough.</P>
<B><P>June 23, 1997</P></B>
<P>It's not enough that my life is in a total shambles. I dreamt about the house again. The Yellow House.  I was in the same secret room as before, but this time there was someone else there.  An old guy. Long white beard and wearing a robe. Just like some wizard from those King Arthur stories.  He said &quot;Look to your Friends&quot;.  Then I woke up.</P>
<B><P>June 27, 1997</P></B>
<P>I'm so depressed. Susan says things like, we'll figure it out and we'll make it but that holds no comfort for me. I was making $64,000 a year. And now I'm begging for the legal limit of $280 dollars a week from unemployment while I grovel to lesser ad agencies than I was with, to take less money, and be lower on the totem-pole. Why? Why me? This sucks. I'm going to have to sell my car.</P>

<P>Again. Again with the Yellow House. Does this mean something? I had a dream last night. I arrived at &quot;my&quot; Yellow House, and there was a party going on. All of my old friends from high school and college were there, which is weird, since I haven't contacted any of them for years!  But it was all so real. I walked around and talked to all of them. I even saw Tracy. The girlfriend from high-school I promised I'd think about marrying after I got out of college, and never, ever contacted again.  And she wasn't even mad. At one point I felt like hiding in my secret room, but the party was so fun that I forgot about it completely. I wonder what all those people are doing now?</P>

<P>Wow! Rod called me today. Hadn't heard from him since high school!! We had talked back then about going to the same college, but my parents wanted me to go to Harvard and they were paying, so it didn't work out. We talked about the old days. Drinking big bottles of wine in the park, the lies we told our parents, the joints we secretly smoked during study hall behind the library. Damn, it was good to hear from him.  He said he's doing good, but not as good as me. Says he heard I was a big shot on Madison Avenue.  Didn't have the balls to tell him I just got canned and that my life is in a shambles.</P>

<P>The fourth was okay. Barbecue. Beers. Same old Same old. I think I was sort of a grouch. I got drunk and told Seth that he was a kiss-ass bastard.  At least that's what Susan says I did. I can't remember. I'm starting to realize that, now that I don't work there anymore, that DG&amp;B isn't that great after all. All those people are fake! I don't think that next year I'm going to have a 4<SUP>th</SUP> of July party.</P>

<P>Weird! I had a dream of that Yellow House again!  It seems so familiar now, but I know I never lived there, or have ever even seen it. But this time, it was just me and my three high-school friends.  I had thought I had more, but I guess these three were the only friends I really ever hung-out with.  And we just talked.  In my yellow house, just like I had never graduated high school and left town to go to college. It was so comfortable. Not like the stress I'm dealing with now.</P>
<P>Susan's giving me a bunch of crap about my future job status.  I told here I was working on it, but it doesn't seem good enough for her.  I suggested we take out a new mortgage or sell the second car, and she freaked out.  Screw her.  Not like SHE ever worked for anything in her life, or went through any hard times.  I love her, but she just can't understand.</P>
<B><P>July 9, 1997</P></B>
<P>This is getting strange.  I went to the Yellow House.  I mean I actually WENT there.  Susan was nagging me, again, about the finances, and I was getting really bored since I've heard it all before.  I was laying on the couch, watching TV, and actually remember myself falling asleep. I wanted to go to the Yellow House and I did. That simple.  I was in my secret room and the old wizard guy was there. He was saying over and over &quot;Look to your friends&quot;. Over and over. And then I woke up to Susan's high-pitched nagging telling me what a jerk I was for falling asleep and not listening to her.  I think I married a bitch.</P>

<P>I should have written during the crisis. I'm sure I'll regret it later. But here's what's happened. Susan and I are through. She moved back to Denver, I am still here. I've come to the conclusion that she never really loved me, she just was after the success I represented.  I had a hard time getting over her, but now I am.</P>
<P>But it's her loss because now I'm doing better than I ever had, even when I was with her.  Screw my old job and screw her. I'm not making as much as I did before, but I'm rid of Susan the gold-digger,  I'm writing again (for a newspaper in the same town I went to high-school) and I get to drink with Pete and Phil and Rod again. Go figure.  And  when I was here, in high-school, I couldn't wait to get out, but now I like the town.  It's peaceful.  I'm thinking of buying a house here. It's a fixer-upper, but it's a big Victorian looking place, and it's yellow.</P>
