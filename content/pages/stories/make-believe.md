# Make Believe

John and Larry are seated at a table, near the bar. The music is too loud, the patrons are too drunk, and the beer is too weak, so it feels comfortably familiar.

Larry speaks first. "Haven't talked to you in awhile, John. What's going on?"

John shrugs. "Getting a divorce. She got custody of everything. She got the *house*, Larry. My family owned that house for generations. It came to me, and I lost it because I let the wrong woman in. I thought things were going to be perfect. But she just kept changing the rules, she would get violent, and the *lies*... the lies just broke my heart."

Larry pats his friend on the shoulder in encouragement; John continues. "So I'm out on my ass, with no place to call my own, and all I have in this world is this bottle." He holds up the beer in question and takes a long drink.

Larry's eyes are sympathetic. "I'm sorry pal. If it's any consolation, I'm probably there with ya. I'm losing my job. People keep telling me I don't have the skills to stay relevant, but they say how much they like me personally. Nobody understands what I really do there. They sing my praises to the boss, but then tell me I'm outdated."

John sighs. The two men raise their beer bottles; the clink of glass on glass is the only sound of their wordless mutual toast. As they move to drink again, a waitress approaches. "What are you boys up to tonight?" she asks with a smile.

"We're just playing Cowboy and Indian."
