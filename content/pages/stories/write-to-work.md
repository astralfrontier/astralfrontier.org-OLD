# Write to Work

TODO

Premise: fictional characters brought out of books for use as slave labor & test subjects. Metaphor for dehumanization of the poor - people on talk shows etc. saying "they're just fictional, who cares about them?"

POV character: librarian ("like a commandant at Auschwitz")
Finale:
1. Librarian leaves behind a diary hoping he can be reconstituted after his own death
2. Librarian throws autobiography of rich asshole into the defic machine to see if the guy is actually "real" himself - the 99% not so different than then 1%
