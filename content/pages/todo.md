Doctor Who fan art concept

Someone has to have enough art skill to do this justice. It's not me, but:

Vampires and stage magic

There were these rocketry capsules that released a plague or virus or something into the atmosphere, causing an outbreak of biologically-sourced vampirism among the general populace. For whatever reason it had hit a group of professional skiiers pretty hard, and there were discussions about whether this constituted a physical disability for them.

In the background of this, I was trying to decide where to go one morning around 9 or 10 am - to university, where I thought I had classes (but hadn.t signed up for the semester after all), or to work, or somewhere else. During this time I had to adjudicate a gun duel between two stage magicians, who were using all their tricks to fool the other. I apparently had real telekinesis and used it to keep the contest non-lethal, but I in turn had to cover it up with an explanation of hypnosis and misdirection.

I switched perspectives to a young man with glasses (who I noticed had different lenses for each eye) who was part of a small rebel group against a large interplanetary organization. He had to use a mixture of stealth and feigned surrender to get close to his target. I ended up as myself trying to save his life and doing so with a duel between a trained dog backed by telekinesis and the visiting commanding officer of another planet.

Today's political cartoon which I can't draw.

A married couple are standing in a home, presumed to be theirs, looking at a man in a stereotypical vampiric getup (tuxedo, cape, fangs, etc.) who has just come in via the front door. He is waving a thick sheaf of paperwork. Caption: "We at MegaBank don't have to be invited in, we've still got your mortgage".

The Psychic Curse

So I picture this psychic detective (such as Nick Knack on a bad day) - inspired by Sherlock Holmes as portrayed in the recent films, but with psychometry or clairvoyance of some kind. Sure, he might be great at solving cases, but he lives at home as a neurotic wreck. Why? Because his powers are on, ALL THE TIME.

When he looks at people, he sees their past history crowded around them. When he interacts with objects, they come with their own emotional weight in a similar fashion. He interacts with people via video, CCTV cameras at his home, and so on to avoid this effect. He's very sensitive to people touching his belongings, as it leaves behind psychic residue. Everything he eats or uses is shipped via some impersonal delivery service.

I realized Nick could be used for this, in a comic plot where someone had infected the (city's/world's) psychics with an effect that monumentally boosted their powers at the expense of control. Telepaths would go mad from the onslaught of thoughts, telekinetics would have to restrain themselves in some fashion, and so on.

One vignette might have a psychic placed in a padded cell - but because of the residue of insanity accumulated in such a cell over the years, this would be the absolutely worst thing for him.
