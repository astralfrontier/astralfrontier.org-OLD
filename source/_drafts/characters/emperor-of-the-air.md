title: The Emperor of the Air
---

Black-clad mystery men have been seen gunning down unrepentant criminals. Mysterious three-legged war machines are rising in New Jersey to fight off waves of the alien invaders. What could be going on?

In the 1920s, a radio engineer and several colleagues went down in a plane crash near Tibet. The engineer was rescued and healed by an old priest. In gratitude, the engineer became his student; recognizing potential, the priest taught him the secret powers of the Orient.

The radio man learned to affect the minds of men. Crystals have always had occult power, and the crystal sets used in radio could be harnessed to create convincing illusions, so real to so many people that they effectively took on a reality of their own. With his knowledge of radio, and the newfound powers of mind that he could unlock with a crystal set, the engineer returned to America to fight crime. And thanks to the yogic disciplines he'd also acquired, he would never age and so never need to give up the fight.

Over time, he used his powers for good, and sometimes found them twisted to evil - for he was only a technician, and depended on others to lend a true creative spark to the illusions he could create. He hid himself behind his creations, and only recently has revealed himself to the world as the Emperor of the Air.
