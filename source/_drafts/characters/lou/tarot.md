# Lou and the Tarot

I don't believe the Tarot has any supernatural power, but as a tool for randomly generating narrative for fictional characters, it's entertaining. I laid out some cards for [Lou], my corporate type in a Tron game, and came up with the following.

* Significator: [The Emperor]
* Cover card: [Eight of Wands]
* Obstacle card: [The World]
* Crowning card: [The Hanged Man]
* Support Card: [The Heirophant]
* Past Card: [Six of Swords]
* Future Card: [Page of Pentacles]
* Self Card: [Seven of Cups]
* House Card: [Nine of Pentacles]
* Hope/Fear Card: [The Chariot]
* Outcome Card: [Five of Pentacles]

Lou's challenge is the end of things - everything is about to change. The most favorable outcome for this development is the surrender to newness, to become one with the all-pervading new universe of the Grid which is he about to experience. The Eight of Wands can mean "swift news", but it might also imply the high-speed nature of the electronic world.

Lou is aided by his friends, knowledgeable in the technical domain, and he would do well to re-examine his assumptions about the world he is entering. 

The past card suggests travel has occurred; this may suggest the buyout of AAI by ENCOM. Before him is a change in his work - he is about to become a student of some new discipline. The people around him, his coworkers at AAI, are suffering from wishful thinking about what recent developments with ENCOM could mean; only Lou and his friends will be able to see the reality.

In his attempt to deal with the Grid, Lou will face a struggle - a union of opposites, a war, or a conflict of some other kind. The final outcome suggests material trouble, and a loss of security. Lou will lose his old life in some way, the sacrifice he must make to achieve the Great Work that the Grid offers.
