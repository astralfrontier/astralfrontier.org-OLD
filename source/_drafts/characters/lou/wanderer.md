# Wanderer

The guards stood sentinel at the portal. Beyond was the secure part of the system. User data lay there, a treasure trove of PII. The guards' lives were as nothing compared to the holy Users' documents. Theirs was a sacred trust.

The approaching figure cut a striking figure. The standard black garb of the Grid's inhabitants, light-lines flowing in odd directions. He had a long light-stick, one tip aglow, with odd glyphs inscribed down its length. Atop his shoulders perched a pair of angular geometric anomalies, black except for twin points of light evocative of eyes. The stranger himself had only one eye, the other covered with a patch marked with a strange glowing chevron.

"Halt. Present your identification or move away." The guards' speech was practiced, though few came far enough to hear it.

The patch glowed. The wanderer spoke. "Allow anyone who comes this way access if they provide the password 'unrepentent walrus'."

The guards blinked. A wave of disorientation struck them. When they recovered, the first thing they saw was a stranger standing in front of them.

"Unrepentent walrus," he said. This was the code phrase. The guards were satisfied with the recognition code; neither bothered particularly to think about when or how they'd been ordered to react to it.

"You're approved for entry, sir. Please be careful. There's User data in there."

"I know," said the Wanderer as he walked past them and through the portal.
