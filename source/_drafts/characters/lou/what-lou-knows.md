# What Lou Knows

### Established Facts

* The laser apparatus came from Flynn's Arcade.
  * An arcade token was found in the packing box.
  * The shipping was traced back to the Arcade.
  * A nearby security guard confirmed seeing Alan Bradley at the site.
* The laser was probably constructed by two people, one of whom was Kevin Flynn.
  * Handwriting in notebooks found on the site show two people.
* ENCOM has established security around the Arcade.
  * The security guard at the nearby ENCOM warehouse had keys for the Arcade locks.

### What does Lou think happened?

Walter Gibbs and Lora Baines work on laser technology.
When Kevin Flynn ascends at ENCOM, he takes stock of the systems
that the company has been working on. He finds the laser system
personally interesting. With the help of one of ENCOM's experts
(the second author in the discovered notebooks), he sets up a new
system at home - still the hobbyist/enthusiast.
When he disappears, the laser sits ignored.

Sam learned about the laser experiments from his father.
Taking over the company allows him to properly invest time, money,
and expertise in developing laser technology further. As a part of that,
he asks Alan to take charge of securing his father's old hobbyist apparatus,
since it represents an independent development of the technology and might
prove useful for understanding it. Alan throws some locks around the arcade,
sends some workers down to retrieve it, and hands it off to us.

Why is this a problem? Because of the secrecy - AAI has the Sword of Damocles
hanging over it. If we were supposed to be the new laser experts on this, Lou
would have expected more official notice, more information about the laser
location, access to the site, etc. Instead, this was done under the radar.
It looks bad. It looks like what you'd do if you want to milk a few outgoing
employees of their knowledge on a CEO's pet project before you dump them.
So Lou is concerned.

### Open questions

__Who is the second person to work on the laser?__

It has to be someone who matches three criteria:

1. Someone Kevin Flynn knew would know about the laser system
2. Someone Flynn would have felt he could ask to collaborate with, and
3. Someone who would have reasons to say yes

If Lou does some digging into Flynn's biography, learning about Lora will
convince him that she was the collaborator. Either way, Lou would want to
look at Flynn's biography to pick likely candidates.

__Who pays for the power and phone line at Flynn's Arcade?__

* Kevin Flynn, via a savings account
* Alan Bradley
* Sam Flynn
* Lora Baines
* CLU (?)

Why is this important? Because if Alan and/or Sam have been paying,
that establishes how much they know about the site.

__How did Alan learn about the laser?__

Lou's theory is that Sam was told by his father, and directed Alan to retrieve it.

Whoever did know had enough resources to direct ENCOM to take over the site.

__Why the secrecy?__

The three factions within ENCOM are:

* Sam's supporters (led by Alan Bradley)
* Sam's opponents (led by CEO Richard Mackey)
* undecided parties (including Director of Grid Operations Ed Dillinger)

Word of this getting back to Richard Mackay could be used to hurt Sam's
position (as Flynn's laser was apparently off the books). But Alan isn't
just doing this to hide something that looks bad, he's doing it to
further Sam's goals.
