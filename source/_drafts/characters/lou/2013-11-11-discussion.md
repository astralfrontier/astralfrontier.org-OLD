Summary: Was Lou right to go to the arcade?

# 2013-11-11 Notes

Phil whispers: "The successes with style you got, mean that you can quickly get Quorra back to the grid."

Phil whispers: "As opposed to having to risk her incapacitation or death if you had NOT got the laser working."

Phil whispers: "As to the IC concern about patent infingements, bring it up with Alan. He will admit that it was, in part, a dodge, on account of two concerns: 1) that Quorra might not survive forever outside the Grid, and 2) that he's really NOT convinced that it's a good idea to put Flynn's new technology into anyone's hands. But he can't just destroy it because of (1)."

You whisper Phil: "yeah, getting the laser up quicker made sense, that's the perfect thing to roll for."

You whisper Phil: "as far as Lelouch-style super-strategizing, I'm not expecting you to run Code Geass here. :)  But that mindset, where the character has to be in control of a situation and has the resources to accomplish it, works at any scale, and that's the part I'm interested in playing."

You whisper Phil: "to me, Lou's actions (going to the arcade, confronting Alan) were still correct. He had goals (ensure AAI has a future, ensure that his guys get to work with this laser technology) and those goals were satisfied. 'keeping Alan happy' wasn't a goal; 'not antagonizing Alan sufficiently' WAS. Hopefully that's the impression you got."

Phil whispers: "It's not hard to outmaneuver Alan. He's a nice guy used to dealing with nice guys."

You whisper Phil: "Yeah, I didn't expect it to be difficult. The challenge here was the unknowns of the laser itself and of Sam - Lou went into this knowing almost nothing."

Phil whispers: "A lot of would-be Machiavellians in software are actually stuck deep in the Dunning-Kreuger well. Alan's learned that he can usually pave over those guys by being forthright, upright, and technically competent."

Phil whispers: "He only really ran into trouble with Dillinger, but even he wasn't someone that Alan personally tried to take down. That beef was between Dillinger and Flynn."

Phil whispers: "But you're something new to him."

Phil whispers: "On the one hand he appreciates that you're protecting your firm from layoffs. On the other he's not inclined to trust you more than he has to, because he now knows that you'e NOT an incompetent megalomaniac."

Phil says, "Since I mentioned it to Geoff this morning..."

Phil says, "Something we'll get read into the record: the software you've recovered from the Flynn desk, is in four parts."

Phil says, "A big, impossibly complex program (built on a realtime kernel) for controlling the laser; and a big, impossibly complex Grid program for running some kind of huge simulation. The two are completely disjoint from each other - however, there's a third program that appears to provide some kind of gateway between the digitization algorithm and the vast simulation."

Phil says, "You haven't tried to run the sim or the gateway yet."

Phil says, "And then there's the fourth part."

Phil says, "It's not there."

Phil says, "There's some API calls both in the laser control and the sim that don't seem to have anything that ever calls them."

You say, "Could we reasonably infer that this would do something akin to Kinect-style 3d modeling, like bringing detailed data on (say) an orange into a physics model?"

Phil says, "Are you asking about the laser/sim gateway, or the missing program?"

You say, "the laser/sim gateway"

Phil says, "Yes, that's a reasonable inference."

You say, "okay. Because there's a billion fucking applications for this sort of technology, and the only reason the ENCOM board would shut it down is because they were short-sighted fools. Not saying they AREN'T, but do you want just one example that might occur to Lou?"

Phil says, "Although you're not sure what the sim will do with the data once it's inside. On the other hand, given what you know about the Grid's history with physical simulation, it's possible that it might be simulating the uploaded orange."

Phil says, "Oh, I've thought of a few."

Phil says, "But fire away."

You say, "protein folding. Foldit used humans to solve an HIV enzyme problem in 3 weeks. People spent YEARS trying to compute this. Imagine plugging some biological samples in, finding a problem's solution via the simulation, and literally re-emitting the rewired sample as a real chemical via the laser."

You say, "we digitized a clock. If it was broken, and the simulation let us repair it from the inside out, the implications would be revolutionary. This is the specific stuff Kevin was looking forward to."

Phil says, "So it's vastly powerful."

Phil says, "And applicable to a huge number of very hard problems."

You say, "So yeah. Obviously we have an immediate goal (help the boss's girlfriend in whatever weird way they think the laser will help). But that revolutionary power is something Lou will fight very hard to be a part of"

Phil says, "So you say you want a revolution."
