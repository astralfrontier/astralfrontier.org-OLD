title: ZEUS
---

When the Jupiter Anomaly was announced, NASA put together an ambitious program. A new form of reactor based on advanced physics was to power an autonomous robot that would travel to Jupiter and its moons and explore the phenomenon.

The prototype robot, dubbed the Zero Energy Unmanned Suit or ZEUS, was constructed over 18 months by an international team. Unexpected technical complications led to the project being abandoned after its budget was cut by Congress. The suit and its AI "pilot" were functional, but the propulsion system and instrument package weren't ready. NASA scientists were convinced the project would go nowhere. Then something unexpected happened...

Public interest in the project had been high among science and technology aficionados. Backed by a few wealthy industrialists and investors, they put together a fundraising program. In an unprecedented move, the collective investment was enough to purchase the rights to ZEUS. A steering committee was appointed. A road map was put together. The first autonomic deep space probe was repurposed into the first hobbyist-run, crowd-sourced robotics experiment. Today, ZEUS is worked on by teams of bright, motivated tinkerers around the world. He has become an icon of the DIY movement - and an artificial hero in a world of superheroes.
