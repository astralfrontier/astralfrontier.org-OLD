This is probably the most riced-out Shadowrun character I've ever created, but he was fun for the one-shot he was played in.  The combination of `Way of the Gun' adept powers and Smartlink-II target number reductions meant he was rolling 10 dice or so against a target of 2, even before using Combat Pool dice, using weapons whose damage code was a modified 13S after burst fire.  It wasn't pretty.  I never got the background very fleshed out, but that's ok - he probably won't get play for a long time to come.

I considered adding the Small Unit Tactics skill, since the background is appropriate for it, but I don't know any Shadowrun GMs who use the SUT skill rules.  More should, though. :)
