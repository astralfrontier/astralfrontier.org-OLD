title: Thomas Temple

The coven gathered in the appointed place at the appointed time. Signs known and recognized by the mystically initiated were exchanged among its members. More than once, other covens had been infiltrated - by rivals, by conjured creatures who had outwitted their summoners, or by the forces of what laughably called "civilization". Precautions were in order.

The Lion spoke first. "My son will be of age soon. He is the male, master of the physical world. He is the incomplete half of the Talisman."

The Raven responded. "My daughter will be of age soon. She is the female, mistress of the magical world. She is the incomplete half of the Talisman."

The coven's leader followed. "When the Talisman is joined, all power will be ours. Through the children, and the children's children, until the end of days."

"May it be so," the group intoned.

And when Richard Temple went to see his son after a necessary absence of years, he was shocked. The easily controllable boy he'd thought was secured for the coven had become a young man with an unaccountable mystic block against mental control. "You can't just come back into my life and tell me who I'm going to marry. You've pushed me in the past, but this is the end," Thomas Temple had declared. Richard, furious beyond the capacity for rational thought, left it at that.

Thomas had been raised in a bizarre home. His father had used mental and mystical powers on him from the time he could walk, molding and expanding his mind to receive and process power. His uncle Peter had disappeared in Asia following the war, and would return from time to time with wild stories, dark hints, and esoteric martial arts. Other members of the extended family - with rumored ties to the mystically-minded heretics of the Middle Ages, the Knights Templar - had equally eccentric traits. His mother had died when Tom was very young, and at the time the boy hadn't questioned his father's explanations.

Due to his father's influence, Tom had developed a genius-level intellect by grade school. Richard intended the boy to become a mystic master, like himself, with a mind capable of comprehending inhuman magics and paradoxical arcane truths. What Tom had done with this potential by the time of Richard's return was to take up the study of the sciences. He had enrolled himself in college, and had done well enough at his studies to secure funding to fully cover his tuition.

The coven's plans would be ruined. And despite everything he'd done, Richard loved his son. But something had to be done about the boy...

When the dream came, Thomas Temple was ready. His father - long absent - had told him what to expect. This was the Astral Initiation, and it would determine the direction his magic would eventually take. Richard had left his son with instructions.

Tom didn't follow them. He had his own ideas. In the dream, he molded the world of magic into a seething foam of psychokinetic energy - control over the molecules of the world. His power would obey predictable laws, and he would forevermore be cut off from the outside mysteries. He shut the metaphorical door in the face of his father's mystic tradition. What he gained in exchange was a sense of the material, and the ability to control it.

Thomas has been experimenting with nanotechnology. His ability to discern objects at the micrometric scale, and to likewise control them, has led him to the creation of certain specialized tools for developing and operating nanoscale robotics - nanomachines.

His first and most successful experiment is a suit of light body armor which can become regular clothing, of any style, on command. He has a large preprogrammed library of patterns to choose from. The default pattern is a black, form-fitting outfit with a face mask, gloves and boots. He uses this form of the suit as a costume and operates as a vigilante named Covenant. Believing that he has a responsibility to use his powers for the greater good, he splits his time between college, research, and crimefighting. His experiences with his father left him mistrustful of authority figures in general, and so (for example) he will avoid working with the police or cooperating with law enforcement unless necessary.
