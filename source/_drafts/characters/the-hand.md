title: The Hand
---

The supervillain "The Hand" (as in "...is quicker than the eye") is a professional stage magician with a genuine superpower, or perhaps two: he has perfect photographic recall, and he has a super-vision that can penetrate physical matter and many forms of other barriers.

Kyle McCay was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. From an early age he was fascinated with science, but found it difficult to make friends - there was too much he could see that people would have preferred to keep secret. Instead, the natural world revealed its hidden wonders to his ever-probing eyes. He saw, and saw, and remembered everything he saw in perfect detail.

Kyle found a way to reconnect with people when he saw a performance of stage magic at his school. The magician's patter and jokes obviously had the attention of the audience, and the tricks he was doing were patently obvious to Kyle's penetrant vision. He practiced the tricks over and over, until his hands could replicate the moves his eyes had witnessed. Then he started performing on his own. He'd attend magic shows around his area, then around the country, until he could reliably copy even the most sophisticated tricks.

His professional pride forbade him from actually using his X-Ray vision during a show. He would use it to acquire tricks, but not execute them. Still, he was outed by a rival who managed to somehow prove that Kyle had used his powers to acquire a new trick. He was unable to prove that he had abided by his code of honor and done the tricks "fairly"; to his fellow magicians, he became known as a thief, who couldn't originate an act of his own.

Kyle turned his X-Ray vision to a darker pursuit. He gathered blackmail material on his rival, systematically destroying his life and eventually driving him to suicide. When he was investigated by the powered heroes of his area, who had heard the truth about his abilities from the news, he managed to learn several of their identities and threatened to expose them in court if he was arrested.

Without a career to support himself, Kyle turned to a life of crime. He became "the Hand". He'd remotely study the gadgets used by criminals and vigilantes alike, following them to their lairs and watching them assemble the devices through walls, memorizing the steps. He saw beneath the masks of dozens of supers, revealing or threatening to reveal names and faces - for with his memory and a pencil, he could render a recognizable facial sketch. He'd use the gadgets he mimicked to deal with physical challenges as they arose, and his X-Ray vision to handle the rest. He could leave caches of equipment or traps in an area, his prodigious memory allowing him access to them weeks or months later. He practiced card-throwing by watching experts such as Ricky Jay, and carries a set of sharpened playing cards for use as weapons.

Today, the Hand is a middle-tier operator in the criminal underworld. He uses magic tricks as weapons - his favorite is the use of a smoke grenade to blind his opponents, followed by thrown weapons and bombs guided by his X-Ray vision. He prefers the safety of information gathering to the risk of combat, but is is capable of defending himself should the need arise.
