By all accounts, Simon Lang was a self-important boor, but a decent chap under pressure. The survivors of the Somali pirate attack reported that he'd defended the honor of a female passenger before being thrown overboard for his efforts.

He was living as an expatriate after a summary judgement in the U.K. went against him, and was living off the sale of medically untested and dubiously legitimate herbal supplements, along with instructional videos and a whole universe of related paraphernalia.

Scattered records indicate that he washed ashore in Yemen. The next several months are unclear. The most notable event was his brief imprisonment and dramatic escape in Saudi Arabia.

The guards reported that he needed no food, only water.  After the third day, the door to his cell was blown off by some sort of explosive, timed to coincide with the guards passing by. The locks and hinges showed signs of acid corrosion and metal fatigue. He took out several guards likewise; though the prison administrators swore in their deposition that he'd been given nothing but water, the liquids he used acted like concentrated acid. He jump-started a vehicle missing its battery and escaped unscathed.

Afterward, a new hero appeared in America. He called himself Ginseng and promised homeopathic miracles. He charged the wealthy and aided the needy, but his solutions were undoubted efficacious.

Ginseng's unexplained experiences underwater changed him, giving him a quasi-mystical affinity to water. He's capable of evoking a "water memory", simulating any chemical he's been exposed to given a quantity of water to work with. He has worked considerable feats of internal alchemy, up to and including regenerating serious injuries using nothing more than water.
