title: Requiem
---

Requiem is a vampire knight, sworn to defeat demons with his own dark power.  When forced to fight, his bats surround him and seal his body behind a smooth black armor, and his fearsome two-handed blood blade answers his call.

Background
----------

*Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine - Grant them eternal rest, O Lord.*

Sebastian Lennox was third in line to the Dukedom of Richmond at the time of his apparent death.  A debauched member of his family and a scandal late in his public life, he at least possessed wit, grace, and personality enough to charm his way through a series of conquests and sustain an otherwise-unsustainable lifestyle.

One night, he found himself trussed up and placed in his car by a trio of thugs.  To this day he is convinced that members of his family undertook to remove him by the most discreet and expedient means possible, by making his death look like a racing accident.  Under circumstances he does not speak of, he found himself in the family crypt, with a terrible hunger for blood.  When he stepped out and crossed the field to the churchyard, he jerked himself back as an unbearable pain swept through him.

Since then he has traveled as a vampire.  He avoids the four purified elements of the world: consecrated earth, holy water or natural streams or lakes, the sun's fire, and so on.  Although he is seemingly alive (his heart beats, and his body seems to function otherwise), he need not breathe or eat.  Blood is all that sustains him.

He was formerly an Anglican-Catholic, though he did not practice.   He has started to take religion more seriously since his transformation.

He has no particular grudge against his family; in his mind, his vampiric state is proof enough that he owes penance for his crimes, and he's content to take what comes.  He is still something of a rake, but he restrains himself and performs the duty that's been laid on him.

He goes by the alias Sebastian Karnstein, claiming to have come from the Highgate area of north London.

**Total Powers Costs**: 187

Notes

* The "only in alternate ID" limitation requires a full Phase to activate a given power.  However, Requiem remains in that alternate form as long as a single power in the Multipower with this limitation remains active.  For example, he could activate his Blood Blade and Vampire Knight's Armor powers, then trade the armor for Unholy Strength (Leaping) without losing the blade.
* Bat Surveillance's "physical manifestation" limitation means that characters can observe or destroy the bats which serve as his eyes and ears.  Bats have DCV 6, PD/ED 12, BODY 1.
* Blood Blade's "physical manifestation" is the blade itself - it may be Grabbed or Disarmed, and Requiem must spend at least two full Phases if he wants to get it back without physically retrieving it.
* Bat Form's "lockout" limitation prevents him from using his STR (any of it - no objects may be carried in this form, aside from what he normally carries or wears), his senses, and his regeneration.  It is intended to be a power for convenient travel and emergency escape.

Complications
-------------

* Dependence (Blood), easy to obtain, 2d6 damage, powers at 11-, weakness, once/day [15]
* Distinctive Features (pallid and fanged), concealable, recognizable [10]
* Hunted (religious fanatics), as powerful, infrequently [10]
* Psychological Complication (attracted to beauty), common, strong [15]
* Susceptibility (purified elements), very common, every phase, 1d6 [25]

**Total Complications**: 75

Notes
-----

As an impure creature, Requiem is vulnerable to the pure elements: running water such as a river or stream, the sun's fire, holy water or the smoke from incense blessed by a priest, and so forth.  He may not set foot on holy ground, nor emerge into direct sunlight during the day.

He depends on blood; he must drink at least once a day, or he begins to lose his health, strength and vampiric powers.
