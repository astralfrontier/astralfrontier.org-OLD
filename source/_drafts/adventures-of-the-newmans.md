With the Masks game [winding down](/2018/10/30/the-unmasking/), I thought it might be interesting to continue (or retell) the adventures of Leo Snow and his friends. So what would that look like?

<!-- more -->

I was thinking of writing either a series of stories, or alternately comic scripts (using a tool like Scrivener). So here's what would go into that.

* A mission statement: **Tell stories about real human experiences through safe fictional lenses**
* A roster of characters (main characters, supporting cast, adversaries, etc.), described below
* A setting - probably an adaption of "Silverline City" from [Compleat Villain](/2016/07/19/designing-locations/)
* A series of story arcs, described below
* Plot points and decisions based on solo play using the Masks rules

### Characters: Heroes

**Leo Snow**, alias **Link**, is a troubled teen genius turned superhero.
He is influenced by mecha anime.
He wears a suit of powered armor which uses a smart system of grappling hooks for mobility and combat, but is otherwise unarmed.
The suit can also combine with his friends *Otto* and *Pneuma*.
He is the son of *Grendel's Mother*.
Themes: family, alienation, loneliness.
Masks Playbook: *The Bull*.

**Aria Newman**, alias **Pneuma**, is a gynoid (a humanoid robot).
She can transform into a near-replica of the Link Suit, and combine with it and *Otto*.
She is superhumanly strong and fast.
She assists *Link* with his superhero activities.
She was formerly his girlfriend, but the two broke up over the circumstances of her creation.
Themes: purpose, anxiety, love, humanity.
Masks Playbook: TODO.

**Otto** is a humanoid robot who can transform into a car.
He can combine with the Link Suit and *Pneuma*.
He is large and strong, with rockets for flight.
He identifies primarily as a car, and relates to Leo as a big brother.
Themes: emotional support, accessibility.
Masks Playbook: *The Transformed*.

**TODO** is a heroic speedster.
She has control over vibration, and uses it to accelerate her body at high speeds or do damage.
She is blind, but is capable of navigating and perceiving by sensing vibrations in the air.
Her need to rely on sound rather than light limits her effective speed to under Mach 1, otherwise she cannot navigate safely.
Themes: disability, TODO.
Masks Playbook: TODO.

**Armiger** is a magical swordsman.
He was originally described [here](/2017/08/07/armiger/).
Themes: TODO.
Masks Playbook: *The Legacy*.

**TODO** is a supervillian's daughter turned hero.
Her father is a Killgrave-style psychic manipulator.
She inherited his power, but with the quirk that she can't turn it off.
Anything she says aloud will dominate the minds of people around her.
Out of respect for her teammates and others, she chooses not to speak out loud.
She uses sign language, writing, and texting to communicate.
Her powers do not work on Newman-type robots, putting their humanity into question.
Themes: disability, villainy.
Masks Playbook: TODO.

### Characters: Villains

**Grendel's Mother** is *Link*'s mother.
She is the "mother of monsters": a bio-genetics engineer and researcher who can create clones, cyborgs, and other abominations.
She is a mercenary and arms dealer, equipping other supervillains with living weapons rather than conquering warlord.

**TODO*** is *TODO*'s father.
He has a potent psychic power, which allows him to manipulate people around him by speaking.

### Story Arcs and Themes

These aren't in order, and are necessarily incomplete.

: I think you've got plenty of interesting to talk about regarding "what is human?" that is unique enough to warrant going over that material. There's a bit of a cheat through the Heart Factory ... but even that then extends the question? Where would Summer draw the line on humanity? We've agreed there's a difference between Summer and a Chin Spider-bot ... but what's the bright line (or even justification around the gray line) that divides them? Why would Alycia feel different between shutting down (or reprogramming) Summer from doing the same about Travelycia? Or should she? (The insights around having meat-human brains reprogrammed and re-reprogrammed, as we've had with both Jason and Alycia, inform this, as do some of the things around Leo's past -- those elements or ones based on them ought to be a part of this.) But I think you have plenty you can work with.
