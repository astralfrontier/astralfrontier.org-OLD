I'm working on a roleplaying game, but not one with traditional task resolution. Instead, it's about a group of people with supernatural powers, tasked with resolving crises. The challenge of the game is meant to involve changing the emotional makeup of the community affected by the crisis. For example, maybe a community feels fear, and creating feelings of joy would lead to a resolution. Or there's strong feelings of contempt or anger, but instigating shame would encourage everyone to realize what they're doing is wrong (and at that point the original crisis could be handled).

I researched different models for emotion and came across this one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6vheim_cube_of_emotion

I don't know how accurate this model is, but it distributes major human emotions in a playable way. I converted it into a two-dimensional map, which could be used as a play area, seen here: http://astralfrontier.org/assets/emotion-cube.png

Here's the three points I'm starting from:

1. The crisis is defined by starting conditions - how intensely each emotion is felt at the moment - and a "dark fate" that events will lead into if the PCs did nothing or weren't there.
2. PCs should propose better outcomes, presumably attached to one of the dominant emotions available here, and try to shift the strength of the emotions on the board toward one of those outcomes.
3. This process should not be straightforward - the game rules should yield surprising, interesting, and plausible alternatives to an act of emotional manipulation that doesn't succeed, and that should happen frequently.

With that, I have a bunch of big questions, but here's the major ones.

1. Am I on reasonably solid ground with those three points, from the perspectives of both gaming and psychology?
2. Does the cube of emotion make sense as a starting point for this effort? Or is there a better model? My goal is not something that's a fully realistic emotion simulator, only something that gives "good enough" results.
3. At a high level, what are the properties of emotions in opposition, in a group setting? For example, does it become easier or harder (or the same) to provoke more of an emotion, the stronger it is already? If someone tries to provoke an emotion that's opposed by something already (if Fear is dominant in a group, is it easier or harder to provoke Joy in that group than if nobody felt anything special)? In other words, what are the rules for setting challenges to the players in their attempts to shift feelings?

I've ordered "Handbook of Affective Sciences" (Davidson) and "Handbook of Emotions, 3rd ed" (Lewis), but I don't know how much help those will be. :)

1) I can 98% promise you any emotional model you run with will be disproven before we die. There are some really important things we don't understand that are likely to disrupt most theories once we have the tools to figure them out. So imho consider it fully in the realm of philosophy and treat that part of the system more like building a mythical theology. Ask the players to as-if your model is real as part of the playing contract. Shift effort from realism to the system you want people practicing in.

More as I go.

2) The cube model is one of the most solid given what we currently know.

3) Running from the cube and neuroscience, we would probably want to consider things in terms of homeostasis. Our systems are functionally filled with fail-safes that attempt to deal with inputs but keep things within a set range - body temperature is a fabulous and easy example, as it interacts with our exertion, the exterior temperature, infections, etc and all these complicated things work in concert to keep us within the temperature range our body needs to chemistry.

So for any (person,community,etc) there would be some set point that it tends towards, reinforced by the whole rest of the system. Things that head that way are easier, heading away is harder.

In neurotransmitters, we have this process. Thing happens. Input comes in, stuff we don't fully understand happens, and some neurotransmitters get dumped, usually by a couple specific things we do understand. Those chemicals float around and find receptors. When they connect to the receptor, they do a thing, and as they are held there more chemistry happens and they get made into something else.

Say I get a serotonin dump in the morning. All day long I send that to receptors to help me brain, and as those molecules get used, they get rebuilt into melatonin, which dumps later and goes to receptors and makes me sleep. While I sleep that gets chemistried back into serotonin. That's a huge simplification but its the important stuff.

Now, lets say I take an ssri. That actually goes and sits in some of the serotonin reuptake receptors, similar molecular shape, but it takes longer to break down or something thus leaving more free serotonin to do stuff. Another way I could up serotonin would be to take some 5-htp, the immediate precursor, which would be made into serotonin pretty easily.

Now, the adrenal/cortisol response is interesting, because it looks like that can be impacted by stuff like deep breathing, and emotions like remembering a lovely beach from vacation, or a puppy, or gratitude. That actually disrupts the cycle and brings biomarkers back to homeostasis pretty quickly.

I'm kind of wandering now, so let me know if this is useful or going too far afield.

Now as I'm thinking, I'm almost imagining 2 phases, one walking in on the emotional crisis and trying to disrupt it long enough to find out what built it, then a second detective phase of figuring out the town's cycles and where they break down, and giving them tools they can apply there. Maybe something card based for that part? 

Then like, an external crisis, in which whatever tool cards have been successfully added to the town's memes get played..
Ooh. The town has neurosis "cards". They must be played in the final conflict, using some method. Then the tool cards can be used to disrupt or redirect them, if the players can figure out how to story it. And maybe some superpowers come in to play to tip the scales.

I wrote some sample fiction, intended to capture the rhythm of a particular story in this game. You can read two of them here:

http://astralfrontier.org/fiction/vessels/wild.html

http://astralfrontier.org/fiction/vessels/crown.html

Both of them feature what you are talking about - adherence to the emotional status quo, an act of disruption followed by a reorganization into a new status quo - and so I think we're on the same page. My earlier mistake was treating "disrupt" and "reorganize" as different versions of the same action - emotional manipulation - and I'm now thinking that they're fundamentally different.

You mentioned a detective phase. Discovery in RPGs is a hard problem to solve, so I'm looking more at options like "players announce facts which are true", "players get clues, but those clues can paint an incomplete or misleading picture", but they would effectively do what you're talking about - applying leverage when the town's emotional status quo is vulnerable to it.

The specific nature of the crisis should definitely impact the outcome, though I'm still wrangling with a few different ways to handle that.

Okay, that works too. Yeah your stories have a pattern that's right there on it, AND I see what you're doing there is having the players MODEL behavior to impart it, which is a perfect flavor of unrealistic mechanic that metaphors appropriately. The seeds child in particular, that was a strong one - joyfully participate in the suffering of life, right there, lovely.

I'm not very experienced at playing story games, so please override any suggestions about the play pattern with things that work for reality.

But, I'm kinda imagining stealthing something in somehow - I'm imaging setting up a game where the town crisis is a metaphor for a friend's top fixable struggle, and the seekrit point is to get the friend and their buddies to model for friends problem except this little layer of abstraction is magic -we suck at our own problems apparently only until we file our own serial number off. So that would be an awesome feature!

That is definitely something that I'm aiming for. I commented to Drew that this game is, at bottom, what it's like to be a certain person - to have power to come in, solve some problems, make troublesome things go away, but having to fight through strong emotions or pain or trauma to do it, to struggle against people just not listening, or watching friends drown in despair, reaching a hand out and screaming "take it already".

Going back and reading this more, it sounds like my actions are: break up the inertia of the current situation, remove confounding factors or monkey wrenches, figure out an angle from which you can apply leverage, then finally stick the appropriate lever in and push. Like a smith heating up metal, hammering it into shape, and then quenching it. If each of those things is a distinct move, what's left is to assess ability, difficulty, and complications for each one.

I'm looking back at the Crown story linked earlier. Our lady knight is facing Fear, whose cause is well-understood - it's the intensity of it that challenges her. She'll take Anticipation (aka Excitement) as the best outcome, which the table interprets as representing hope & faith.

She tries to get a handle on the group's fear, but it doesn't happen - maybe the dice don't roll well for her. So the group introduces a heckler, one that'll let her personal experiences, ideals, and identity come into play, and say that the mood shifted not to Anticipation, but to Contempt. From there she can manage Anticipation, uses magic to bust out awesome armor, and wins the scenario. Her actual success in combat against the Bronze Horde is assumed - once she had the faith & trust of the crowd, the game is done saying anything about the outcome and the players should be free to narrate.

The story as written foreshadows the Contempt result. If this is something with mechanical weight to it, perhaps the knight's player can take actions that give her better odds of landing there prior to the big rolls, or maybe there's something on her sheet that says "because I was looked down on at the castle, +2 to beat Contempt stuff". Or it could be that we dealt from a deck that said "Contempt is going to come up in this game, handle it" and the lady knight's player structured her personal story to do so. I personally prefer backstory shaping current narration over the reverse, though.

I LOVE THIS: ~"I have already developed a tool for overcoming contempt" = plus to roll when dealing with it = supporters help manipulate the situation OR perception of tool-holder to move the situation to something they are better at handling.

### Bill Garrett - Jun 29, 2015+1
 
Yeah, "backstory as tactical tool" has been part of the plan since the beginning. Ideally I wanted to provide people both fluff ("you can narrate whatever you like") and crunch ("there's an optimal route through this emotional maze, my understanding of the rules will help me find it.")  That's why it's so important for me to get something approximating good science. :)

...Fluttershy?

.. Seriously that is an interesting post!

Some iterations of the game had a "deflection" mechanic, where emotional shifts that didn't work out would get randomly dropped somewhere else (roll a 1d8 and count clockwise on the map). From our earlier discussion, and from this post, I'm thinking of redoing that. You might be trying to thread a path across the map, and wanting to go one way and failing sends you along the other direction. This might add a new tactical angle, in that you've got multiple routes to a desirable end emotion, and there can be metaphorical land mines waiting along some of those routes.
