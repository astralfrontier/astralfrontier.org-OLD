<title>The Game</title>

<h1 align=left>The Game</h1>

<p>She had only been in Principia for a short time. Her healing had been
recent, and discovery was exhilarating even if the tenor of her way was mere
projection, though in the &quot;real world&quot; this, most certainly, 
would have been termed &quot;memory.&quot;  Audacity smiled as she walked 
toward where the river runs placid to white water and tiny golden lights 
glisten on surfaces both still and moving. Her long auburn hair moved in 
subtle sway upon her shoulders as she strolled slowly to where lush moss 
cushioned her steps as she approached the leafy bower.</p>

<p>&quot;There is a force beyond my vision within the green. I would follow
it.  I would know it.&quot;  She looked back &quot;over there&quot; and 
smiled at her lines.</p>

<p>She HAD known!  Had carried it with her; guarding her secret selfishly,
timidly.  But now, NOW,  she need only to bring it forth.  She had learned
The Way of a true dreamer, and had actually realized her mystical nature.</p>

<p>Audacity, of course this wasn't the name she was known by in the 
&quot;real world,&quot; had enjoyed her fascination with words; a 
fascination that brought her much recognition.</p>

<p>She entered the verdant bower.  Sat down.  Watching the river, Audacity
allowed herself the pleasure of a dreamhaze.  The pulse of awareness excited
her, beckoned her. It was during these times that she would enter &quot;the
game;&quot; a game of intercourse that was mastered by only the most 
sentient of the selected dreamers.  The question was easy to ascertain 
once one entered Principia.  In the world of words,&quot; reading&quot; 
allows one simply to cultivate one's perceptions from the secure 
viewpoint of the spectator, while taking pen to hand forces one to become 
a game player.</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking&quot;, on the other hand, is easier still, for once  
spoken words are uttered, even if they disclose ignorance, they are 
short-lived, and can easily be defended from the stance of 
misunderstanding.</p>

<p>But when one picks up one's pen, look out!  For now, one is, in
truth, a game player.</p>

<p>Audacity  felt the question within the dreamhaze...&quot;Do I want to 
enter the game?  Do I want to <i>know</i>?&quot;</p>

<p>He smiles, and his eyes, penetrating and silent, tremble leaves to fall
in delicate drift upon the still-moving current.  His presence, unseen, yet
powerful, moves in silence, envelops, invades...He enters expectant and
excited by his passions.  He singes the souls of sentient beings caught in
the madness of his Divinity.  Yet, they would come here in their burning.
The game players could not do otherwise.  For theirs is the passion that
sparks the process creating an eternal return.  Seduction glitters, capturing
eyes birthed empty of invitation, of dismissal.  In the intense light, a
dark silence, a sudden burst of color glinting beyond vision... and another
game player <i>knows the moment</i>.</p>

<p>Audacity's initiation into the realm of &quot;game player&quot;  was the 
highest of honors.  Though this esteemed place existed, there is no tangible
evidence of the game, nor the players. Who can touch the subtle sway of 
motion somewhere within the recesses of the mind?  Who can write of eyes, 
deep and penetrating that do not seek to probe, to hold, nor invite, yet 
welcome freely, unbidden?  Soft spoken intellect offers gentle self-words: 
unedited images ease to coalescence distance, time and circumstances.  It 
is here, in the Dreamhaze, that the tapestry of existence is ever 
merging with the future...</p>

<p>Letting the haze take her along, she feels the slow turning.  There is
an  intricacy of rhythm that is intermingled with the constancy of an 
urgency that impels. It wasn't by accident that Audacity had been drawn to
the River. It is here, in this leafy bower, that she begins to feel.
White-water rush and power of force marks smooth patterns upon her receptive
soul. Spontaneous etchings, are they offerings, or signatures? Is the
flowing placid or swift, silent or ear-splitting?  Depth of meaning?
Interpretation?  A river runs through her mind, taking her to places she's
never been.  And she has no need for words.  She <b>is</b> the river.</p>

<p>A sudden chill.  She shivers and draws her denim clad legs together
hugging her self, and arching her back slightly, she rests her face on 
her knees.  Still drifting in the last vestiges of a dreamhaze, she 
listens to birdcalls that seem to dance the river sounds to lilting 
music.  The rhythms of nature take her in amused drift to that day in the 
Wilds.  Could she still hear the laughter that heralds springtime in the 
forest?  Is it possible that Audacity will ever know <i>how</i> it had 
happened?  Maybe, if she could find a guide...Perhaps one of the other 
game players would go with her...</p>

<p>Her excitement was almost beyond containment!  She rose.  Brushed
strands of moss and green grass from her clothing as she walked jauntily out
of the bower and into her quest for a guide to take her back to the Wilds.
Her mind was racing as she formulated a plan to find the perfect game
player.  She would know him by his smile, by his eyes.  There was  a place,
if only she could recall the name of it....</p>

<p>In a pub teeming with dreamers, and buzzing with the noisy chatter
of their discourse, a man sits alone, quietly observing.  Picking up his
glass, he pauses to gaze at its contents, its contour.  His fingers circle
the rim of the glass in slow deliberate caress.  There is the faint sound of
a solitary note...</p>

<p>Startled, Audacity paused.  She had come to Ur-Giger, drawn to this
city by her transcendent intuitive capacities: this being what lesser 
worlds tend to incorporate within something called esp: extra sensory 
perception.  Some phrases still bring a grin to mind!  Extra senses, 
indeed!  People refuse to listen.  Even when given the rules for 
realizing ultimate Truth,  but a few have the tenacity of spirit not to 
compromise their values, let alone their dignity.  It was this same 
spirit that brought her to the Dream Society.  And it is this same spirit, 
though on a much higher plane, that found her hurrying along streets and 
avenues strange, but vaguely familiar.  As though from a distance beyond 
her ken, an aeolian harp sends its haunting note...and the note echoes 
through the ages, there and not there, heard and not heard: an invisible 
catalyst that travels in waves like sunlight filtered through ricepaper, 
and just as warm.</p>

<p>Ah, &quot;Philosophy by the Glassful&quot;, struck a chord within the 
recesses of her mind.  Her hesitation was a momentary lapse in reason.  
Even in her elevated dream-state vestiges of learned behavior  attempts 
selectivity.  But such discrimination  dissipates in Principia as the 
Dreamer begins to heal.  Danger resides only in a corporeal context.  No 
one bleeds here.  Glancing at the sign that bore the name of the pub, 
Audacity pushed open the large door and entered.</p>

<p>She found herself a table in the corner directly across from the door ;
where a sense of &quot;being apart&quot;, from the occupants of the busy 
pub, afforded her the opportunity to note the comings and goings of the 
place.</p>

<p>Audacity reached for the crystal glass with a lightness of touch
reserved for finer fragile things.  The wine-dark voices of ages past, an
intoxicating presence that commands obeisance.  Rite and ritual pervade,
ordering realities and altered states. &quot;Something is always left 
behind,&quot; she muses.  There is always the lure to grasp meaning from 
within, from that which has gone before in theory, or in form.  There's a 
presence that is formed from a gathering.  A presence that is silent and 
alone; that touches in ways that transcend the nature of things.</p>

<p>She was a watcher. Even here her eyes move slowly, watching, noting
the various modes of dress and speech.  She heard discussions in buzzing
undertone that upheld the name of this pub.  The offerings of good will are
a matter of form, easily accepted and promoted. Her astute eye caught his
gaze  She stared back at him, slightly irritated that she had fallin into
them.  He held her with his eyes. Such intensity of purpose will have its way. 
   &quot;I am here to find a guide.&quot; She did not smile.
&quot;You are free to leave.  Your will is yours alone.&quot;  He  
watched her with an intensity that caused him slight consternation.  
Here, in the Dream Society, one determined one's own creative 
visualization.  One directed one's thoughts to feel whatever one 
desired.  One also had the ability to choose the relative intensity, or 
lack, of feeling.</p>

<p>She is affecting me.  How is this possible?</p>

<p>&quot;You will be my guide.  Your eyes tell me that you have been 
there.&quot;  She approached in slow drift, sitting across the table from 
him and abjectly running her finger along the rim of her glass.</p>

<p>His gaze held hers.  He nodded.  &quot;What is it you are seeking?&quot;
he asked, his voice cloaking his interest.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?  I want to know , &quot;why&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it the nature of man to want to know why?  To what purpose then?
Does knowing change anything?  I think not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think you can refrain from moralizing?  It is not my 
concern as to what your opinions are.  I want to know &quot;why&quot;.  
There's something missing.  I need to find it.  I can only know by going 
back.&quot;</p>

<p>He smiled at her spunk.  Here, one's feelings hurt only if one wanted
them to!  She is letting me know much more than her plans.  He thought...he
reflected.  The ambiance of this pub presented reflection.  Place, objects
all offer a presence that invites a coalesence: a magical wonderment moving,
weaving in and out, within and about an intermingling rhythmic slow dance
that captures, takes one mesmerized and falling to a new place so far away
from everywhere.  And if one is lucky enough, or daring enough, or aware
enough, sometimes it is a place to be shared.</p>

<p>&quot;I will be your guide on one condition.&quot;  He asserted.

<p>&quot;Must I bargain for your guidance?&quot;  She questioned with just 
a hint of sarcasm.  The price for solicitation is often measured during 
the silent interim between the asking and the reply.  Anxiety builds for 
the person of lesser confidence.  She smiled slowly as she thought of the 
masks that body language enables one to don; masks that can be quickly 
worn. The simplistic, or exquisite disguises were only a security of the 
moment.  But the  facade is short-lived when witnessed by a discerning eye.
She looked askance at him, annoyed by her sudden need to look away.</p>

<p>His grin did not surface.  He had known this woman; had carried her
inside the deepest part of him.  He had searched his entire life for one
touch, one caress.  What is it?  She is searching for &quot;why&quot;;
I want to know &quot;what&quot;.  Sunlight glints upon moving water for 
an instant and is gone.  What is this raging desire?  What?  Over there 
there were times when I could feel it...always just beyond reach.  Is 
that laughter I hear?  There is a capriciousness that borders the edge of 
knowing.</p>

<p>Her smile intrigues.  What mysteries does it hold?  There is an 
arrogance that attracts, that lures...an arrogance that is born of pride and
lost innocence?  Her spirit beckons; she is a love song.  I want to hear her
music in slow dance.  I want to know her.  And in the knowing will I have my
answer?  Will she have hers?</p>

<p>He spoke quietly, &quot;If I am to be your guide, you must agree to 
surrender all your pretenses, your masks, without hesitation.  Only then 
will I show you the Way.&quot;</p>

<p>Carefully, deliberately without pause, she said. &quot;I accept.&quot;  
They left &quot;Philosophy By The Glassful&quot;...</p>

<h1 align=left>In the Wilds</h1>

<p>She stood rooted to the wet sand, staring at black water etched with
dancing shards of moonlight.  The wind moaned sensuously, caressing her
naked body.  The distant creaking sounds reached her with a sudden grasp
that sparked terror.  Anda turned with an anguished gasp, and began to run
as the moon reflected streaks of fire that seemed to emanate from her long
auburn hair.</p>

<p>&quot;...Damn!  The path is steep; can't breathe--run you dummy, run--Get
the Hell out of here.  Really!  Why am I running?   Calm down,
stupid--you're not afraid of the dark, are you?&quot; she laughs hysterically to
herself.</p>

<p>The river-sounds grow more intense, as she runs wildly, unhampered by
the sharp quartz rock cutting her feet.</p>

<p>&quot;At last, oh Christ, I made it,&quot; she laughs and falls 
exhausted upon the huge granite boulder at the top of the river path 
where she had made camp.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, thank god,&quot; she utters, closing her eyes and lying on her 
back; the cold hardness of the rock comforting her.</p>

<p>&quot;Breathe deep, relax--there--your head's back--such a clearness,
beautifully empty.  I knew you'd do it,&quot;  See you're not destroyed, you're
NOT,&quot; she repeats to herself.  &quot;It's only the night, nothing 
more.&quot;</p>

<p>Opening her eyes slowly, Anda searches the sky, and plays a little
mental game as she begins to name the constellations:  &quot;Big 
Dipper,  Cygnus, Aquila, Scorpio--Scorpion--Scorpions, ugh!&quot;  She 
mutters.</p>

<p>Suddenly, she hears footsteps.  A twig snaps a few feet away. 
Startled, she sits up.  &quot;Oh my God, I'm naked,&quot; she muses 
hurridly, then annoyed.  &quot;Who in Hell could be here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Greetings, naked lady,&quot; a deep throaty voice exclaims.</p>

<p>Anda recognized the insolent stance, the mocking voice.  So, he thinks
he'll shock me.  I'll show him.  Anda was determined not to let him know how
perfectly embarrassed she was.  Despite her efforts, she began to tremble,
annoyed with herself, yet unable to quell the sudden flush of heat that
pulsed through her shivering body.  Disgustedly, she heard herself murmur
breathlessly, &quot;Blake...&quot;</p>
    
<p>His eyes held her.  {She made no move to cover herself, he noticed.
Still, that faraway look in her eyes, but she's nervous, he thought.</p>

<p>&quot;His eyes are like the ocean, the tides, and I'm drowning.  What a
laugh, I'M drowning.&quot;  Anda's thoughts seem to scream in her head. 
&quot; He mustn't suspect!&quot;  With all the strength in her quaking 
frame, she grinned quickly at Blake, and turning her head to look at the 
silhouetted trees behind him, she asked solemnly,  &quot;Blake, why did 
you come here?&quot;  A moment passed and the night sounds roared in her 
ears. &quot; Why doesn't he speak?&quot;</p>

<p>She turned her gaze to catch a glimpse, and once again his eyes held 
her, as he smiled and answered strangely, &quot;For nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So he's playing games,&quot; Anda thought shrewdly.</p>

<p>&quot;Really, Anda, don't you think you ought to get your clothes 
on?&quot; Blake remarked with just a trace of sarcasm.</p>

<p>&quot;Humph!  I don't have any, sir,&quot; she grinned impishly, 
confident for the moment that the game-playing was temporarily suspended.</p>

<p>&quot;Then follow me to my cabin.  There must be something there of mine
that you can put on,&quot; his reply sounding somewhat like a demand, as he
turned abruptly and began to walk carefully among the gaunt pines and black
oaks.</p>

<p>He seems so damn sure that I'll follow him.  Alright, I will.  This
ought to be most interesting.  &quot;OK Mr. Blake Hall, you have no idea what
you're tangling with,&quot;  Anda chuckled to herself.</p>

<p>They walked along silently.  Once, he even paused, his back still
toward her, and held a branch.  &quot;How nice,&quot; Anda noticed, 
until just as she was about to pass, he let the branch go, the impact 
sounding especially loud as it  whipped upon her left shoulder and 
breast.  She stifled a cry as the burning sting penetrated.  Gritting her 
teeth, she cursed under her breath, &quot;You bastard.&quot;  She was 
angry now.  Not just angry.  Red hot fury pulsed to a steady throb within 
the veins of her neck and clenched jaw.  &quot;I know I heard him 
chuckle, the bastard.&quot;</p>

<p>Beyond Blake's tall dark figure, she saw the light from his cabin,
heard the low growl and fierce bark of his hound dog.  &quot;Hmm, that's 
odd, &quot; Anda thought, &quot;he's got 'Bacchus' chained.&quot;  She 
began to feel a sense of foreboding that she culdn't quite comprehend.  
She couldn't help feeling that it was unusual for his dog to be chained.  
That hound goes everywhere with Blake.  &quot;Oh Hell, am I being 
paranid?  I'll just have to get rid of it, my conscience, I 
guess...causes paranoia,&quot; Anda declared smugly to her ever 
chattering mind.</p>

<p>Blake walked easily toward the cabin door, opened it and disappeared
within. Anda walked slowly, scrutinizing the small garden to the right of
the path that led to the cabin, reaching down to pat &quot;Bacchus&quot; 
just to make sure he wouldn't take her leg off...or something.  The cabin 
door opened and she looked up at Blake's tall figure looming over her 
from the doorway. &quot;Well, aren't you coming in?&quot; he questioned.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, yeah, sure,&quot; stammered Anda.  Blake turned, and she 
followed him into the dimly lit, single-room dwelling.  Her eyes darting 
to every corner of the room until she's instantly blinded, as a blanket 
flies through the air covering her face with a thrust that almost topples 
her over.  Groping, she pulls the blanket from her head in time to catch 
Blake's wide smile, as he turns to the fireplace.<p>

<p>&quot;Oh damn, that's twice!&quot; she growled furiously to herself as she
nodded curtly with a forced smile upon her lips.  Wrapping the plaid blanket
tightly around her, Anda decides to sit on the long, softly cushioned couch,
and resumes her exploration of the room while still managing to keep one eye
on the gentleman building a fire.  To the right of the stone fireplace are a
number of books neatly arranged on built-in bookshelves.  In the corner,
beneath a small window, there is a crude cabinet containing a sink.  A
counter extends from here outward into the room, where an old wooden chair
stands slightly askew, oblivious to the plate and coffee cup on the counter.
Across from this counter, against the opposite wall, is the couch Anda's
sitting on.  In front of her, a little off-center of the room, stands a
round wooden table with a flowered tablecloth placed perfectly upon it.  In
the center of this burned  a kerosene lantern, the only light aside from
that given by the crackling wood burning in the fireplace.  At the far left
of the fireplace is an old brass bed.  Anda stared, as the fire reflected
dancing gold patterns from the brass rails.</p>

<p>&quot;Hungry?&quot; Blake asks as he rises from in front of the 
fireplace and stands looking at Anda.</p>

<p>She nods her head &quot;yes&quot; as Blake walks to a small ice-box next 
to the sink and takes out a plate of fried chicken, sets it on the table 
by the lantern, and reaches for a couple glasses in the cupboard above.  
Opening the ice-box door, he brings both glasses and a carton of milk to 
the table in one motion.  Ignoring Anda, Blake concentrates on pouring 
the milk into the two tall glasses. Picking up a chicken leg, he tosses 
it to her with the single command, &quot;Catch!&quot;</p>

<p>Anda reaches quickly for the flying missile, and the blanket around her
falls to her waist, revealing a very swollen red welt from her shoulder
across her left breast, as Blake's grin turns to ovbious concern.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn, didn't mean to cause that.  Here, let me get you something to
put on that welt,&quot; he states, as he turns hurridly towards the 
bathroom, the only other room [if it can be called a room] sectioned off 
in a corner by the door.  &quot;Here's some salve I used last year when I 
cut my hand rigging up the beams of this place,&quot; he explained, as he 
sat beside her and began applying the unctious ointment gently upon the 
ugly red welt.</p>

<p>Anda, clutching the chicken leg, sits stunned, looks first up at Blake's
face, and then at the hand calmly spreading the sticky salve upon her; again
looking back up to his face.  She can't help thinking what a perfectly
ridiculous painting this scene would be to an artist.</p>

<p>The feel of the blanket, the hypnotic glow from the fire, and Blake's
presence seemed to be gathering Anda; drawing her into the suddenly tense
awareness that seemed to merge and find full expression within Blake's
large, rough hand against her naked flesh.  Averting her eyes from Blake,
she focus's her attention upon the faded geometric pattern of the rug; but
she feels the nipple of her breast pressing hard against his wrist.
Chemistry always was her downfall!  For just an instant she felt him pause,
her breast throbbing to the rhythm of the blood pulsing through his wrist.
Did he notice, or did she just imagine his hesitation?  Suddenly, her breast
is free from his touch.  Anda feels as though she's been rudely interrupted,
but smiles sardonically as she turns to Blake.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, doctor.   How long before I can be up and 
around?&quot;  she taunts.</p>

<p>Blake starts to say something, then apparently changes his mind.  After
studying her for a minute, he retorts, &quot;From the looks of your feet, it'll
be a while.  Your feet are bleeding,&quot; and he reaches down and pulls them
onto his lap as Anda lands backwards along the couch, struggling on one
elbow to watch as he begins to apply the salve onto her cut feet.</p>

<p>&quot;Hell, I may as well lie here an relax,&quot; she muses and takes 
a bite out of the as-yet untouched chicken leg she's still hanging onto.</p>

<p>&quot;Ouch!&quot; Anda exclaims, as Blake slaps the bottoms of her feet.
&quot;There, you'll be good as new in the morning.  That salve works 
wonders,&quot; says Blake as he shoves her feet off of his lap while 
rising abruptly,and reaching for a piece of chicken, watches her as he 
sits down on the wooden chair.</p>

<p>Anda, regaining her composure, arranges the blanket back up underneath
her chin.  Holding onto the warm cloth with one hand, she finishes her
chicken leg.  &quot;May I have my milk now? she questions demurely.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, my dear,&quot; Blake responds, bringing the glass to 
her, and with a slight bow, sits down beside her as he lights a 
cigarette.</p>

<p>Drinking the milk slowly, Anda studies Blake.  The confident way he
drags deeply on his cigarette, leaning his head back slightly, savoring the
taste before exhaling.  She watches the blue smoke curling and drifing
towards the ceiling in a sort of lazy slow motion.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, are you going to tell me what you were doing today up here 
on my mountain?  You're a long way from home, &quot; Blake remarks with 
studied nonchalance.</p>

<p>&quot;Your mountain?&quot; Anda asks somewhat incredulously.</p>

<p>Blake, smiling, &quot;Yes, my mountain.  After all, no one else lives 
within ten miles of this place.  You know that,&quot; he replies almost
accusingly.</p>

<p>Blake knew that Anda lived in Rock Creek, twenty miles away.  He spoke
to her often when he'd stop by the Forest Service office where she worked.
He was the only Ranger living up on Slate Mountain close to the remote
lookout where old Thelma Setters spent her summers peering through field
glasses and &quot;spotting&quot; fires...among other things.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn,&quot; thought Anda, &quot;have to think--got to stall for 
time--think, dammit think--had he been down by the river today?  Thelma!  
forgot about ole &quot;hawk-eye&quot;--the stories she used to bring back 
to town when fire season was over!  Could she have seen me at the 
river?&quot;  Anda thought about how difficult it was to camouflage the 
radio equipment she needed for the job.</p>

<p>&quot;Anda, look at me,&quot; demanded Blake.  &quot;What were you 
smiling about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, why?&quot;  She surpressed a giggle at her camouflaged 
radio set-up.  Only she would have thought of the &quot;outdoor&quot; 
powder room!</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you must have been smiling about something.  What is 
it?&quot; Blake insisted rather irritably.</p>

<p>&quot;None of your business, Mr. Forest Ranger,&quot; Anda chided 
sarcastically.  There, better to just let him know than to try an cover 
up.  &quot;Uh, did you go on patrol today, Blake?&quot; she questioned 
subtly.</p>

<p>&quot;And that is none of your business, madam&quot; growled Blake.</p>

<p>Point: counterpoint.</p>

<p>&quot;Chalk one up for the Ranger,&quot; exclaimed Anda.</p>

<p>&quot;You can 'chalk' all you want to; I'm going to bed.  It's too 
late for you to leave.  Besides, you can't walk, or drive that car of 
yours tonight with feet like yours,&quot; stated Blake in a rather 
clinical tone as he walked toward the brass bed and, turning his back, 
began to remove his clothes.</p>

<p>Anda watched him carefully as he slowly removed first his shirt and
then his shoes, last his Levis.  Picking up a pillow from the bed, he tosses
it to Anda.  &quot;Here, be comfortable, you've already got a 
blanket.&quot;</p>

<p>Anda caught the pillow easily, and as Blake turned to get into bed, she
grabbed the chicken bone from off the table and hurled it across the room.
From the sudden groan of bed springs, she knew she'd been right on 
target.</p>

<p>Chuckling, Blake moaned, &quot;Quick, get the salve, Anda, I've been 
wounded.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, shut up!&quot; Anda muttered, as she rose to blow out the 
lantern, before she stretched comfortably back onto the couch.</p>

<p>&quot;The least he could have done was to offer to let me sleep in the 
bed,&quot; she thought, as she nestled into the deep softness of the 
couch, pulling the blanket over her head in a futile attempt of defiance.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Anda, want to sleep in the bed?&quot;  Blake taunted as the 
flames from the fire revealed dancing shadows around the room.  
&quot;Pleasant dreams, my lady.&quot;  Blake murmured.</p>

<p>Anda drifted to sleep, puzzling over the strange way he murmured that
last remark.</p>

<p>From somewhere Anda heard the wind surrounding the cabin as though
searching furiously to enter.  She sat up abruptly, trying to remember where
she was.  Her eyes, straining in the darkness, discovered the soft glow of
embers in the fireplace.  Suddenly, she was afraid.  She trembled as she
recalled the dream that woke her.   Her long hair flowing as  she swam--the
current growing stronger, the distance from shore growing greater and
greater and her lungs burning; muscles: taut, aching, heavy...her eyes
closing...the piercing, ringing, singing her into the black water...and then
the river turning to red, deeper red; until the water became a hillside
blazing with brilliant crimson flowers as she walked.  It was as though the
sun's energy had manifested itself within the blossoms.  A stream meandered
among the flowers and the hillside became veiled in a drizzling golden 
mist.</p>

<p>Shivering, Anda rose, groped her way over to the wood box and picked up
a large chunk of cedar, placing it on the hot embers.  Instantly she heard
the quick crackling as tiny flames began to dart playfully around the log.
She held the blanket around her, gathering it up a bit so that she wouldn't
trip.  Grimacing, she stepped on what felt an awful lot like an old chicken
bone as she tip-toed towards the brass bed where Blake lie sleeping.  The
bed creaked loudly as she crept over his legs and settled herself between
him and the wall of the cabin...closer to the wall.  She moved carefully to
find a comfortable position, and finally, with her back against the wall,
and her blanket covering her, she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Blake, feigning sleep, watched Anda, felt her as she crept carefully
over his legs to lie beside him.  &quot;Was now the time to tell her?  No, he'd
wait til morning.  Her mind seems independent of each scene she sees, and
yet, perhaps she knows...&quot;</p>

<p>Still pretending, Blake rolls over, his body wedging Anda against the
wall.  Their bodies pressed together, he feels her flesh tense, yet she
remains silent.  His eyes are still closed.  He forces himself not to grin
as silence muffles the sound of the wind outside the cabin.  Her breath is
warm upon his neck.</p>

<p>&quot;Damnit!&quot; swears Anda to herself as she wakens with a jolt and 
finds herself pinned between the cold cabin wall and Blake's burning 
body.  &quot;His body's on fire and his heart's beating faster than a 
human being's ought to.  He can't be asleep! The crafty bastard's playing 
games again!  All right, sir, deal me in.  I'm a great poker player.  I 
won't move.  I'll just lie here pretending I'm asleep.&quot;</p>

<p>Flesh touching flesh, mind over mind, until Anda feels the familiar
drifting.  Her mind begins to wander within its own thoughts. Her body
begins to ease gently into the moment of weakness, beyond will...and the
shadows creep upon the wall as she puts her arms around Blake's shoulders,
running her hands slowly over muscle fed with blood, to strength.</p>

<p>They do not speak.  An ancient message pulses in the blood.  The verb
&quot;to be&quot; moves, relating subject to predicate.  The winds outside have
brushed the trees and followed trails into the darkness, searching the
morning.  And the trees stand waiting within the cold, still dark sensing
the warm breath of dawn, as beyond, deer, lying in lush meadows, raise their
heads feeling the same primal force that rises with a new day: the need, the
want, the urge to see tomorrow; to catch a glimpse of  that breath of
awareness, already beyond grasp.</p>

<p>Anda lie in the bed laughing, watching Blake a he bursts back into the
cabin, letting in the draft of a mountain morning as he drops an armload of
wood in front of the fireplace.  He does a sort of Indian ritual dance,
warming himself before he begins to build a fire.</p>

<p>&quot;You'd have made one hell of an Indian.&quot; laughs Anda.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn right,&quot; retorts Blake, &quot;and you should see how I 
stalk deer,&quot; Blake replies casting a sidelong glance in Anda's 
direction.</p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot; Anda remarks unable to cloak the sound of guarded 
caution in her voice.</p>

<p>Having started the fire, Blake  walks to the bed, sits on the edge of
it, and begins dressing.  Fully clothed, he turns to Anda.</p>

<p>&quot;You going to sleep all day?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But sir, I have no clothes to wear,&quot; she says in the voice of 
Little Red Riding Hood.</p>

<p>&quot;All the better to...&quot;, grins Blake, taking the part of Big 
Bad You Know Who! &quot;Sit tight, or rather lie, and I shall bring you 
velvet robes and glass slippers,&quot; Blake states gallantly.  Rising, 
he walks over to a small closet beside the bed.  He reaches inside, and 
turning with a wry smile, he silently places each piece of Anda's 
clothing on the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>Anda's smile appears to be frozen upon her face, but her eyes reflect
the sudden terror--the trapped feeling of every creature that has ever been
tracked, stalked, hunted--haunted!  &quot;Time to play another scene, the
audience is waiting, held by her expression--come on, react...react!&quot; she's
telling herself.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, those don't look like velvet, kind sir,&quot; she mimicks.</p>

<p>Blake stands looking at her in silence.  His face expressionless, but
for the set line in his jaw.</p>

<p>&quot;So, he's not talking.  I guess this act is a solo performance.  I 
won't show fear.&quot;  Anda pushes the covers back and slips silently 
out of the warm bed.  Looking directly into Blake's eyes, she reaches 
first for her jeans.  &quot;If I can just hold him until I can get to the 
door.&quot;  jeans on, she reaches for her faded blouse, wincing slightly 
as the cotton material rubs against the welt on her flesh.  Her shoes 
aren't there on the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you have my shoes?&quot; she asks as calmly as she can.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I don't Anda.  Let's have some breakfast, then we'll go to the
river and see if we can find them,&quot; Blake answers patiently, almost as
though she were a child being chided for losing her  shoes.</p>

<p>&quot;Great! I'm famished,&quot; Anda exclaims enthused.  &quot;Good 
grief, now I have to fake it through grub and then he's going to the 
river.  I can't go to the river.  He's stronger than I am, but then, I 
think I can probably out-swim him,&quot; Anda muses rapidly.  
&quot;That's it,&quot; she thinks, &quot;we'll go down to the river and 
I'll get away.  Slate should be running his logging truck down Rock Creek 
Road sometime this afternoon.  I'll hitch a ride from him.  Slate never 
was one to ask questions.  He'll be safe.  That's it--the river, then 
Slate, then home, and no one will be the wiser, for a while at least.  I'll
be able to figure things out better when I get home.   Why worry now?  Blake
doesn't know; he's guessing,&quot; Anda figured mentally.</p>

<p>&quot;Good.  How about bacon and eggs?&quot; Blake doesn't wait for an 
answer, as he proceeds to get the stated items ready for the frying pan.  
&quot;Make the coffee, Anda,&quot; he orders.</p>

<p>&quot;Sure, I'll run down to the river for water,&quot; she laughs 
looking him right in the eye, taunting him.  &quot;Let's see how you 
react to that, Sherlock!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's water over at the sink.  The first thing I did when I bought
this place was dig a well.&quot; he remarked softly. &quot;Crafty 
bitch,&quot; Blake observed, grinning as her eyes appeared to widen at 
the mention of the well.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, alright, hope it tastes good,&quot; she mutters.</p>

<p>&quot;What tastes good?&quot; Blake asks irritated.</p>

<p>&quot;The water, dummy.&quot;  'There, smartie,' she thinks, as she 
turns with a shrug.</p>

<p>&quot;It does, you'll see,&quot; he remarks.</p>

<p>But Anda couldn't see his face as he said that, so she choose to ignore
a seemingly ominous feeling creeping upward along her spine.</p>

<p>They ate in silence.  When they were finished, blake rose and walked
slowly toward the door, stopped, and turning to Anda--</p>

<p>&quot;Let's go look for your shoes.&quot;</p>

<p>She nods, rises easily and walks past him and out through the door he
holds open, into the morning.  Hesitating a moment, she asks Blake why
Bacchus is tied, realizing her mistake as soon as she's said it.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; Blake replies.  &quot;Come're Bacchus, good dog.  
It's time for you to go hunting; good dog.  go caatch me a rabbit.  He's 
the best damn hunter in the world,&quot; Blake pronounces prooudly.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn,&quot; thout Anda, &quot;How in hell will I ever get away 
with that hound loose?&quot;  Now there's no hiding her fear.  Suddenly 
everything seems real, too real.  Even the forest turns soundless as she 
walks toward the river.  Her feet hurt, but she doesn't feel the 
pain--&quot;Yes, it's real, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p><i>--And the sun's golden fire weaves through delicate sheen of damp grass
and blue willow leaning over the water's edge.  She stood rooted to the wet
sand, staring as waater-ripples lap at the shore--</i></p>

<p>Tossing the heavy rock into the water, she turns and picks up her 
shoes.</p>

<p>She pauses a moment, turning her head toward the river, and begins to
undress.  The sunlight burns streaks of fire in her auburn hair.  
&quot;Oh, what the hell?&quot; she laughs as she runs until once again 
she feels the cold comfort enveloping her.  Her hair flows freely in the 
waves, as she dives beneath the surface.  Rising, she finds herself 
watching the colors veiled in drizzling golden mist, and the river runs 
red.</p>

<p>He sat staring into the glass, watching the flickering reflections from
the fire that danced in the warm red wine.  Outside the cabin, the wind
suddenly brought the eerie call of the owl; the only cry of the dark that
brings the silence that pierces the deepest core of lonely listeners.</p>

<p>Blake rose, walked to the window to watch the stars.  Somehow the stars
would always remind him of Anda.  She was beautiful in the night.  Her eyes
wide with awe and fear.  He remembered how the fire in the room seemed to
find expression within her hair.  Blake smiled to himself and nodded.  She
was a lovely creature, so free...she shouldn't have come to my mountain.
She knew, she knew she'd have to cross the river...<i>They all do, sooner 
or later.</i>  He laughed a little wildly.</p>

<p>The crashing sound of shattering glass raped the dark silence, as crimson
wine began to bubble and hiss, mingling with the flames of the fire.</p>

<h1 align=left>The Hospital</h1>

<p>She was in Heaven.  &quot;So, that is what an Angel looks like,&quot; 
she muttered to herself.  The figure in the distance seemed to waver 
like the undulating waves of a gossamer skirt in evening's summer 
breeze.  Slowly her vision cleared.  She laughed out loud as she 
realized that she was lying flat on her back, looking through the bars 
of her hospital bed at the person across the room from her.  Anda felt 
the disappointment as she realized that she wasn't in Heaven after all.  
&quot;Well, at least this isn't Hell.&quot; she giggled.</p>

<p>Her gaze circled the room slowly.  Puzzled, she wondered how she got 
here.  &quot;Ah, at last the first glimmer of recollection,&quot; she 
thought as she watched her  best friend approach her hospital bed. Jude 
always came through for her.  Theirs was the kind of friendship that 
defied the usual labels.  Each accepted the other for the  person she 
was at the moment.  Maybe we are the only two people in the world who 
can  truly accept another; freely without the need to judge?  I wonder...</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Jude!&quot; I greeted her with a grin that came easily when 
meeting Jude's eyes.  I noticed her scowl fleeting as she feigned 
mature, maternal, do-goodie-type-concern!  St. Jude was a name she  had 
chosen for herself in a moment of playful fancy.</p>

<p>&quot;Why? Why did you go  to the river  alone?&quot;  Jude asked with a 
note of annoyance masked in an attempt to convey sincere concern.</p>

<p>&quot;I wanted to know &quot;why&quot;.  Why was it no one ever 
returned from the other side of the river?  Why was Blake the only one 
who ever crossed over, unscathed, year after year?&quot;  I said in a 
feeble voice, my eyes averted from Jude's.</p>

<p>&quot;And did you get your answer?&quot; scoffed Jude.  &quot;It looks 
to me as though you got more than you bargained for.  For Christ's 
sake, Anda, look at you!  Your ribs are crushed, your face is swollen 
and blue, and your  arm is broken.  What happened?&quot; she 
questioned, as her hand brushed my hair from my bruised cheek.</p>

<p>I smiled as I reached to touch Jude's hand.  &quot;I know why, Jude.  I 
knew all along.  I crossed the river and found ....&quot;</p>

<p>Only Jude saw the look in her eyes, and that look would remain with her 
forever.  Jude yelled for assistance.  She ran wildly down the hospital 
corridor , screaming for  a nurse, a doctor, anyone!  People were running.
The room Anda was in became alive with commotion, practiced regimens 
were performed with a chaotic singleness of purpose that only the 
practiced professional knows.</p>

<p>Anda felt herself slipping away.  She heard a loud male voice 
stating, &quot;She's turning sour!  Get her into OR stat, damnit, I said 
move it, now !&quot;  Strange, she couldn't feel  anything.  All she 
could do is hear.  The male voice said, &quot;Sign here, or die.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't see...&quot;</p>
