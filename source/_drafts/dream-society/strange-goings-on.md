# The Strange Goings-on at The Third Table

Ceridh knew it was going to be one of those nights.

Night and day are very subjective in the White Kitten Inn. The weather outside is whatever most people expect it to be. There's sunlight and there's not sunlight, it really depends on the whim of the populace that's around and paying attention. In fact, large parts of the terrain outside the Inn are in flux. That's probably why most people like staying in the White Kitten. Even when they're dreaming, humans like stability.

Most people have taken to calling the Dreaming Society "night", with "day" being one of the more vulgar insults you can hear in the streets. After all, if you've done well enough to reach the White Kitten, it's a good bet that day life isn't very impressive.

Ceridh thought about these things and asked himself why bad things happen in a place where there aren't supposed to be bad things happening. There's no death, no taxes, no money and no food to worry about (unless you WANT to worry about them). If you were the sort of person that could frequently be found in the Society, the sort of person who enjoyed learning new things and going new places and talking to people on the merit of them having an interesting face, you might sit down with Ceridh and ask him why he had a glum look on his face (which he had). He might tell you something like this:

Peter Romanhoff is a systems engineer for Digital Equipment Corporation; that's his day job. This last week, a lot of people got "downsized", himself included. To managers, this means less expenses and more profits for the company. To employees, it means stress and suffering, as a new job needs to be procured whilst convincing the interviewer that you didn't get sacked because you're a lazy bastard or a prick who doesn't get along with anybody else.

Peter submitted the usual resumes, made the usual phone calls, called his cable company and disconnected service, stocked up on ramen, and watched his savings account dwindle. Today, he got a new position. The catch is that he'll be on a much lower salary, and the job is purely probationary. When a hiring agent tells him probationary, Peter has been taught to hear "you'll be working your ass off to prove yourself to us". So he's not stressing over finding a job -- that's cake. He's stressing over wasting time and precious job-search time trying out for an unknown job situation and having two strikes against him.

So, he dreams. There's a tall, gray-cloaked man named Ceridh that rides into Principia quite often on his roan horse. He has a stern mien and gray-flecked eyes that show wells of sadness and iron strength. Ceridh is a polite, if quiet, fellow, and despite his attempts to hide his emotions, his face almost always betrays him. Experienced dreamers know that you can dip into someone's emotions without looking at a face, but even experienced dreamers are socially conditioned.

If asked his name, Ceridh would tell you, "Ceridh". If you mentioned Peter Romanhoff, he might not acknowledge who you were talking about for a few seconds, and if he felt inclined to talk about it, he'd probably refer to Peter in the third person.

Most people consider it bad form, or even vaguely obscene, to discuss dayside matters in the White Kitten, and so it's not talked about loudly. Ceridh is one of the rare ones who's willing to talk about his dayside existence. So there he was, bull-headedly doing just that, flying in the face of tradition. The man who sat down at his table was an older-looking fellow, with white hair and a long white beard. This meant nothing, of course, but people who choose to take on older forms and aren't playing Merlin or Gandalf are usually fairly mature, and so Ceridh had welcomed him. Predictably, the man had asked him about his long face.

Predictably, Ceridh told him about Peter's life problems. "It's been a long, long day," he finished. "Oh yeah.. you been here awhile?" The man nodded in the affirmative.

"Can you tell me who the woman at the third table over there is then?" The man looked behind him at the empty table. "Err.. what woman?" Ceridh glanced over his shoulder, "Damn. She keeps doing that. I thought people had to come in through the Wilds, but she keeps disappearing and reappearing, and nobody else seems to have seen her. I don't think I'm crazy.."

The man smiled, "That's very interesting. I see people there too, never a woman though. Usually I see my day father, but sometimes it's people I don't know about. Have you asked the Innkeeper about it?"

"Not yet..perhaps we should both talk to him."

Both men rose and proceeded to the bar. Louie was tending bar. In the absence of a human bartender, Louie was good at wiping glasses, filling drinks, listening to the newest story of pathos, and being cheerful. Beyond that, he wasn't much good. The collective human unconsciousness that drove the White Kitten and created illusions like Louie could generally agree on what a bartender should be up to that point -- any sort of personality above and beyond that, and Louie's existence became very uncertain. So most people didn't try to tax him too much. The question they had was easy though: "Is the Innkeeper in there?" Louie nodded and sent them into the back room.

The Innkeeper was sitting at his desk shuffling through paperwork. He looked up, his eyes focusing on both men. **Can I help you gentlemen?** came his telepathic voice.

"Err.. yessir," Ceridh began. Talking to the Innkeeper was an imposing and significant event in one's nightside life. Most people went through three stages in their relationship with the Innkeeper, such as it might be. The first stage was the buildup: people who talked to the White Kitten's regulars would hear stories of the Innkeeper and fear him. The Innkeeper had quite a reputation among the less-experienced regulars. Stories handed down from ancient times, literally decades ago when the White Kitten had first been founded, told of the Investors' Invasion and how literally hundreds of dying souls, passing through the Society on their way to the afterlife, had tried to overrun the Inn, and how the Innkeeper had defeated them and sent them packing to their respective eternal rewards. Other stories abounded with lesser import, such as how nobody ever took advantage of the Inn or its open nature without being "rewarded" with a one-way trip to the Wilds.

The second stage in peoples' relationship occurred when people realized why the Inn was named what it was. The Inkeeper was, in fact, a small white kitten with blue eyes. He had a small, narrow tail that tended to stay in one place unless he was grooming it. It was at this stage, which didn't last long in most cases, that people would laugh and stop taking all the stories seriously. This usually led to the third stage, where the Innkeeper would take a moment of his valuable time to demonstrate exactly why the stories were true. If the person ever decided to revisit the White Kitten again, the third stage progressed, and he and the Innkeeper got along fine.

Ceridh is at this third stage; the old man is still stuck at first. So it took a great deal of effort for him to retain control of himself, and he quickly left the room even as Ceridh began to ask his question, which in effect was: Who is that out at the third table?

**I don't know. I don't recall meeting them,** the Innkeeper replied. **Maybe you should introduce yourself?** Ceridh smiled, "Well yes... but for the fact they keep disappearing, literally."

**You know that's expected behavior. The door is too noisy to be used all the time.**

"Well, yes. But they also reappear. My companion here, " indicating the open office door through which the other man had retreated, "sees other people, not the woman I described, always at that table. Some he knows from dayside too.".

**That's very interesting,** the Innkeeper mused. **I'll look into it when I have a chance. In the meantime, do see if you can introduce yourself and save me some trouble.**

Ceridh bowed low. "I didn't mean to trouble you, but it did seem very peculiar." The Innkeeper nodded and blinked sleepily; the interview was over. Ceridh turned and left.

Predictably, there was nobody at the table when he came out. Lots of predictable things happened at the Inn, that being the reason so many people enjoyed relaxing there. It let the people themselves keep things interesting. Ceridh located the man who'd sat down with him standing by the bar in shock.

"He's a kit----mmph" the man exclaimed, his statement being aborted by a quick-witted placement of Ceridh's left hand over his mouth. To be laughed out of a bar isn't the best way to spend an evening, especially when there's a good chance you won't be able to get back in and you enjoyed the time you spent there. Ceridh saved the situation by quickly replying, "No, he's not kidding." The majority of the crowd missed the nuances of the exchange and by and large ignored it. More quietly, Ceridh continued. "He suggests we introduce ourselves the next time we see this person, or these people, or whatever."

"What's your name anyway? I don't think I had the pleasure."

"Ceridh", Ceridh replied. "Yourself?"

"Justin, Justin Gauge" the old man smiled. "You seem very open about your dayside life. I should let you know I'm not willing to be as open about such things, and I hope you will understand."

Ceridh nodded. "I respect the distinction. It's a pleasure to meet you, sir."

They brushed past a couple, a man leading a rather undefined woman to the bar as she gushed, "You mean this is where we dream...?". New dreamers, thought Ceridh. Ahh, the days of youth. Ceridh returned to his table while Justin ordered drinks from a pretty waitress in passing. Once seated, the small talk began.

Small talk flows like water at the White Kitten. Outside is for the adventurous, but inside is a place to be a human being, without being black or white, rich or poor, happy or sad. It's a place one can revel in his humanity at, enjoying the company of others, enjoying losing the burden of responsibility. There's no national debt or divorce proceedings to worry about. A long time ago, somebody figured out that small talk was like a green light -- it meant things were ok, just the way they should be. If you could talk bullshit to anybody who sat down with you and feel comfortable doing it, life was going your way.

They talked well into the night over several drinks, and at last Justin spoke up. "I had no idea the Innkeeper was a... a cat. Who is he during the day?"

Ceridh shrugged and smiled. "Nobody knows; nobody really cares. He looks like a cat because he wants to look like a cat. I guess he just likes cats or something. I think part of it is that he enjoys the expressions on the faces of people who meet him for the first time, like you. We're in a universe of dreams. Why do people have to dream about being Rambo or God or whoever all the time? The Innkeeper is someone who likes simple pleasures and straightforward things, people included. Cats lead simple lives. It makes sense." He thought for a moment, sipped his drink. "I think we'd all be better off if we could accept the smallest, simplest things in life as the best. Maybe the 20th century wouldn't be so messed up if we all appreciated what we all have."

The phone rang.

It seemed incongruous. No, wait. It doesn't. It's normal. I'm awake.

The thoughts passed through Peter's sluggish consciousness as the phone continued ringing. He finally gained the presence of mind to pick it up. "Hello?" he managed.

"Peter? It's Marilyn... Marilyn Bowers." The voice was soft, timid. It was Marilyn. She's always been the shy, quiet type.

"Oh.. Marilyn... hi there. What's going on?"

"Peter.. I'm confused. I've been at home all evening.. and I ... I.... I was thinking about you." Peter could hear the embarrassment in her voice, could almost see her pretty face blushing, even through his sleepiness. "I fell asleep.. and dreamed.. and I saw YOU, only it wasn't you.. and you were talking to someone about me.. and it was so real! You must think I'm crazy."

"No... no... it's not crazy..." he mumbled, pulling his thoughts together. "Hang on, let me call you back. What's your number?."

"Are you sure?"

"Yes."

"555-1437."

Peter hung up the phone and got up, slipped on his jeans, and shuffled into the kitchen, wincing as he turned on the light. He got himself a glass of water and returned to the bedroom, clearing his throat between sips, and fumbled with the cordless handset.

She's pretty, he thought. Why is she calling me? We've barely talked. He dialed.

"Hello?"

"Marilyn? .. hi, it's Peter again. Yes."

He talked to the attractive secretary for a few minutes more, establishing that, in fact, she was not crazy, yes, it was certainly ok for her to have dreams with him in them, no, he didn't mind talking to her about this. All the while, the thought was racing through his head: could she have been the woman at the third table? If so, how could she have gotten into the Inn without traversing the Wilds?

"Marilyn... I want you to do something for me."

"Y..yes?"

"I know this will sound crazy.. but I want you to go back to sleep.. and keep thinking about me. And I'll find you. Just trust me."

Silence on the other end. "Ok...."

Peter smiled and said "Ok.. it's ok, go back to sleep."

He hung up. He thought long and carefully about what he was going to do. He composed himself. He laid down. And slept. And dreamed.

Ceridh had ridden for hours through the Wilds on his roan mare. He heard a voice calling softly in the back of his mind, and as he rode it became more and more audible. He rounded a low hillock and saw a woman in a silk nightgown sitting on a log. The terrain around here looked like a desert, though the road Ceridh was riding had been wooded not five minutes before. Dismounting, he walked his horse towards the center of the clearing, and the woman.

He cleared his throat; she looked up slowly, distractedly, like somebody underwater. "Hello Marilyn," he said smiling. She looked up and smiled. "Who are you, sir?"

Ceridh remembered his days as a new dreamer, the symbolism that he had required to get around in the world at first. But she had appeared at the Inn, he thought. Does she really require the symbols?

"I'm your guide," he said, smiling gently. "I'm here for you. Will you ride with me, milady?" He could feel her expectation as palpably as a hand on his arm, wanting to shape him into a cognate, a dream-illusion. In time, she would learn to curb her expectations and desires. For now, it must be accepted.

He felt his form shift, clothing changing into armor; he had become a knight in shining armor, with his roan mare now a handsome white charger. A vestige of his engineer's stubborn insistence on physics imposed solid weight on the armor and he could feel it bearing down on him. He grunted (quietly, hopefully quietly enough for her to miss in her self-centered dreamer's haze) and increased his strength with an effort of will.

Dubiously eyeing his new stallion, he mounted, and beckoned for her to mount as well. As she was caught up by his arm and onto the back of the horse, her nightgown imperceptibly shifted into what could only be described as the dress of a princess. Ceridh was familiar with all manner of clothing styles -- pseudo-Medieval attire was popular in dreams. He had no idea why, but there's no accounting for taste.

"Now, where shall we ride to, milady?" he asked.

"The castle!" she exclaimed, and pointed past his shoulder. Ceridh turned his armored head.

Well, so there was. There was a castle. There was also a moat, with a forest around it. There were pennants lining the castle walls. There was even a dirt road leading to. Ceridh shrugged mentally and steered his mount towards it, Marilyn gripping his waist tightly (perhaps too tightly) all the way.

They arrived at the castle. The drawbridge was down (?). It had been up before. He thought. Well, she's in control. He rode inside.

He assisted Marilyn in dismounting, then dismounted himself. The horse stood where it was, conveniently. Before she could indulge in more fairy-tale material, Ceridh removed his helmet and looked at her slowly and carefully. "What is it, my prince?" she asked.

"Marilyn.. I have something to tell you. Most people learn this only after several times.. but I think you will accept it. I have a feeling about you."

She looked a little confused. Her haze still had her in its grasp; she'd have a hard time hearing anything that didn't fall into the domain of the fantasy-dream she had constructed.

"Your name is Marilyn Bowers.. before you were here, you called a man.. Peter Romanhoff. You told him you had dreamed about him."

Marilyn nodded, still confused but hearing him.

He ran his hand across his face, altering his features to be those of his day self. When he removed his hand, she gasped, "it's you!"

He nodded. "And you are having a dream. This is a dream. But it's also real."

She shook her head, confusedly. "So I'm dreaming about you?".

"In a way, yes. More accurately, we're both having the same dream. And when you wake up, you'll hopefully remember what I've said. And I will remember what you said. And I will talk to you tomorrow, and tell you about this dream. I hope you'll remember. But for now, Marilyn, it's time to go back to sleep, and stop dreaming. I don't want you to be shocked or surprised tomorrow. It's very important that you remember what I'm saying, and be prepared for it."

Marilyn nodded dumbly. At last she shook her head and blinked a couple times, and finally asked, "How do I go back to sleep?"

"Do you see that large oak door set into the castle wall?" She looked. There it was, just as Ceridh had indicated. "Yes... I see it."

"Walk through it. When you do, you'll go back to sleep."

She started walking, and turned hesitantly. "Is this real?"

"As real as the day. Being a dream doesn't mean it's not real, Marilyn."

She nodded, and slowly walked towards and into the doorway.

"This is Mr. Grantz' office, may I help you?"

"Marilyn, it's Peter Romanhoff. I need to ask you something."

"Of course, Mr. Romanhoff."

"Do you remember what you dreamed last night, Marilyn? About a knight on a white horse, and a castle?" He could hear the embarrassed silence settling onto the line for several long moments, before hearing a very quiet "Yes"

"And do you remember what the knight said to you?"

"I don't think we should be discussing my personal life, Mr. Romanhoff."

"Marilyn, it was me. You remember it was me."

Another long silence. "How did you know?"

"The dream was real, Marilyn. You and I talked together, were together, and conscious, in the dream."

"Look... I really need to go."

Peter heard the phone disconnect, and felt the pangs of doubt in his heart. He hoped he hadn't frightened her off.

**I found out something about your friend,** the Innkeeper related by way of casual conversation, in a rare moment. Ceridh raised his eyebrows. The white kitten on the bar nodded sagely and continued lapping at a saucer of cream set before him. The Inn was empty; Peter was sleeping in over the weekend, so the European crowd hadn't shown up yet.

**Turns out she's one of those few rare naturally telepathic individuals,** the Innkeeper continued. **Most telepaths either find out early in life, which keeps them enthralled enough with dayside thoughts, or never realize their talent exists, which means they won't be looking for the Dreaming Society in the first place. So your friend is quite unique.**

"How do you know these things?" Ceridh inquired.

**Because I'm one of the other rare naturally telepathic individuals on Earth.**

"Oh."

**Will you be bringing her into Society?**

"I think so. Well.. I hope so. I am not sure she's accepted what I've shown her so far. I hope you'll be willing to accept her in here, though."

**Certainly. Any friend of yours is a friend of mine.**
