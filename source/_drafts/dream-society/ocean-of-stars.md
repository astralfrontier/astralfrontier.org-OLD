# The Ocean of Stars

(Excerpts from the personal journal of Herbie Holmes)

## April 12

It's only been a couple days since I started seeing this new shrink. What he told me was absolutely true: if I just let myself have normal, natural dreams, my life will really come into focus. He told me to write down the dreams I had, and he likes to talk about them during the session.

Anyway, I guess what he said made sense to me in some weird, deep way, because both my dreams so far were about him. They were both a lot of fun, but the details are sorta hazy.

I was on a beach. The sun was very bright, and I could see some kind of resort, or club, or beach-house off in the distance. There were lots of people out in the surf. They were playing, doing all kinds of things. It was very surreal, but still very real and detailed. I remember it was in color.

We all laughed and played and ate and drank and went to the resort building. There was a jacuzzi there, and several hot girls in nice bikinis joined the doc and I in a dip. We all drank martinis but I didn't get drunk at all.

I asked Dr. Soames about the ocean but he said we should wait before going in there.

## April 15

I got my taxes in barely on time this year. It wasn't stressful like it is usually. I need to go buy Donald a beer some night to say thanks for telling me about Soames.

Today was my third session. He doesn't seem like a shrink at all to me now. More like a buddy, somebody I can relate to and talk to. He's even better than Helen. All that bitch wanted was my money and my Jag, but Dr. Soames seems like he really cares.

He's probably the only person aside from my parents that I thought I could really trust.. and I feel like what happens to me matters.

We talked about the ocean. All of my dreams so far have the ocean as a part of them, but I'm never allowed to enter it. It goes on forever and I've seen the sunset cast a shine across the water. I see people playing in it but it seems like every time I try to go into the ocean I wake up.

Dr. Soames thinks the ocean represents some great unfinished work, or something I want to do but don't have the courage or the heart to do yet. He talks like a poet would write sometimes, but it's so efficient. He doesn't use a lot of flowery words, he just talks, and you feel what he means because he couldn't mean anything else. I told him he should have been a public speaker, and he just laughed.

We talked about the divorce proceedings until my hour was up, and when I left his office he said something that struck me as odd. "Herbie, the next time you dream about the ocean, forget that it's a dream. Here.." He wrote something on a piece of paper and looked at me. "Don't read this, and I mean whatever you do, do not read this until tomorrow. I want you to figure it out for yourself. When you wake up tomorrow, read what's on the paper, and figure it out. Ok?"

I promised him I wouldn't read it. He put it in an envelope, sealed it shut, and gave it to me.

## April 16

It's the strangest thing. Maybe it will help if I write it all down in the order it happened.

I was at the resort again, talking to some of the women there and Dr. Soames. This time I knew it was him, but it didn't look like him at all: he was wearing some kind of robe with symbols all over it, and a mask, and nobody else seemed to know who he was. Everybody treated him real nice, but it seemed like they were afraid of him.

One of the girls I had dreamed about was there, I somehow knew her name was Beth. We went into one of the private jacuzzi rooms and relaxed and drank, then we went out onto the veranda and made love under the starlight. She told me that it was ok, because we were by the ocean and everything is ok when you have the starlight.

I remember it, but I don't know when it happened. Dr. Soames gave me a piece of paper and I read it. It said 555-2472. It was the clearest and most real part of the whole dream. I remember feeling the texture of saltwater on the paper, I remember seeing the lines on it, I remember seeing the writing in pencil.

That morning I got up and started cooking like usual. I burned my eggs and toast, though. I had grabbed the envelope Soames had given me in his office yesterday. There was a piece of paper inside it, folded up. It had a single phone number on it: 555-2472.

## April 19

It's been three days since I called up Dr. Soames at home -- the number he had written down was his home phone number. That day I'd almost yelled into the phone. Now as I hang up with him, it all becomes clear. The dream I had last night explained it all to me.

He had told me to "figure it out myself". He was right, and I feel like such a fool for expecting him to hand it to me on a platter.

It all became clear after I took a swim in the ocean.

My last dream was on a beach. This time there was no resort. I was ready for the ocean. I didn't need anything else. I was prepared.

I waded out into the clear blue water, looking down and seeing only a swirling of water. The sunlight shone down on me, reflecting off the rippling water and forming miniature rainbows.

I paddled out a little further. I submerged, and opened my eyes.

But what I saw wasn't anything what I expected.

Below me, stretching off into infinity, were the stars. They were clearer and brighter than any I'd ever seen. I could feel the terrible emptiness of the space I was in, and for several panic-stricken moments felt as though I would fall. But finally I regained myself. It was a dream, I thought, and I didn't need to breathe.

The fact that I could think and reason was surprising to me. Every dream I'd had until that time was me seeing and doing, but never acting or taking any kind of initiative. I opened my mouth and felt no water rush in, but I didn't feel out of breath.

I looked, and the starry expanse spread out beyond me. I looked up, and could see the faint shimmer of sunlight on ocean water. I kicked a few times up to the surface, and my head came out looking up into a sunny sky over an ocean of unfathomable distance. I turned myself around in the water and looked, and saw the beach, right where I thought it should be.

I dove in again and swam through the universe under the ocean for what felt like hours. I could feel a comforting warmth around me. It was the most beautiful feeling I'd ever experienced. Somehow, in some way, I just knew what it all was.

The phone number -- I had not seen the paper, not seen Dr. Soames write on it, I had no way to know what was there. I had dreamed it before I saw it, and both in the dream and in his office it was Soames who gave me the number. I've never, ever dreamed in words or numbers before.

The dreams, all about the same place, all starting just when I meet with Dr. Soames. The ocean of stars, with the whispered secrets of humanity and the primal warmth of love and compassion infusing it. It was all real, in some strange, unexplainable way, but I knew it was real.

It's impossible, but it's true.

## July 7

Beth and I have been dating for two weeks. Soames assured me that all the strange coincidences lately -- my new job where Beth lives, my pay raise, my weight loss -- are all normal, and although he's never explained just who his fellow "Warlocks" really are, he's glad they had the chance to help me. I couldn't tell him how grateful I was.

I've changed so much. Looking back on my life, I can't even remember why I thought I needed a psychiatrist in the first place. Of course, I still talk to Dr. Soames. But I don't do it on the phone, and I haven't been to his office since April. The dream-world he introduced me to still has its drawbacks, but it has some wonderful benefits as well.

And whenever there's something that's bothering me, I take a dip in the Ocean of Stars. Soames talks about something called a "collective human unconscious" and manipulating "socialization-induced trance states", but the Ocean means something else to me. It's a place where I can put my problems in front of myself. It's not a place for forgetting, more like a million caring human beings all supporting you as you figure out where you need to go in your life.

I tell all my friends that Dr. Soames is the man to see. I also refer my friends around here to Dr. Charles Norton, an associate of Soames and fellow psychiatrist. He and Soames work together professionally, helping people like me remember what life can be, when you stop worrying about money and position, and start living for the sake of living.

The best part is, this whole dream-universe wasn't necessary for me to learn that lesson. All it did was help me along.
