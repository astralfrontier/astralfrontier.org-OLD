<p align="center"><strong>The Dark Shining Green</strong></p>

<p>He was a breed of his own making; singular entity reached only
through networks of intricate routings that seek changing domains.  He is the
constant that some seek.  Those whose searching becomes an errant quest
for meaning, or for the answer to the question, <em>why</em>.  He was a service
provider and troubleshooter.  He was the man in charge.  He kept the intranet
moving.  His fingers danced over the keys as though the secret forces of the
universe surged in electric bursts infusing message and code with purposeful
directives and data ordered by his command of presence and power.  He
was good, the best, and he knew it without the pomposity of those who
strive.  His is the unaddressed simplicity of expertise.  Genius never does
recognize a mirror, or an adversary.</p>

<p> For some he is the ghost in the machine.  For others, he's the man
whose essence is encoded by his own design discerned only by <em>his</em> edict;
<em>his</em> invitation, after calculating the coefficients of continuity and character.  Distant, apart from demeanor of necessity, or for recognition of
acceptance, he watches.  He waits...</p>

<p>Does anything reach a ghost?  Does anyone approach the  man in charge?
Only if the  man permits contact.  He watches without expectation, and that
alone keeps advantage in his realm.  An advantage he chose  to
possess.  He wasn't concerned with <em>why</em>.  He held a part of him for
<em>what</em>.  He knew why.  Patience disciplines the watcher who has become
the defender of all whose <em>why</em> interrupt an otherwise perfect system.
He guards what none can know, knowing there would be a time somewhere when he
would meet, <em>what?</em>  Everything has its season.</p>

<p>Principia had long been the place where they were brought to heal. 
The corporeal <em>house</em> they were accustomed to, as a point of collected
references, was no longer.  The new arrivals are assigned guides.  Guides
who had entered the Dream Society having been healed by others such as
they; those whose inner world transcended an egocentric corporeal condition
of purpose.  Principia was the place.; the guides, the force that nurtured its
own.  But there is another force in Principia.  It is an energy: a prehension of
concrescence that is an event of convergence that knows satisfaction.  And it
is <strong>this event</strong> that elicits the players of the Game.</p>

<p> The Game is talked about in metaphors.  It's whispered about in the
silence between the dialogue and the beating heart.  The  Game is present
between the empty spaces that punctuate the walking toward and the inner
retreat.  Game players of the Dream Society aren't selected by any hierarchy,
as is the way in the Wild: the <em>other side.</em>  Game players can enter the
dreamhaze of other dreamers, thus entering realms that allow the ebb and
flow of understanding.</p>

<p> The Game was the final guardian of the Dream Society.  The ultimate
assurance that Principia <em>be</em>.  And as with any game, there is the
Master of the Game.  He didn't need to be elected in any sense of the word.
He had always been aware of the intertwining coalescence of being.  His was
the will afforded the sentient being who has mastered the awareness of self
relative to others, yet with a singleness of purpose that defined.  His
identity is attained by a courage felt by other game players, but mastered by
him alone.  His is an authority without dominance.  He <strong>is</strong> a game master.

<p> Slate spent his days at the shop drawing confidence from his technical
background.  He stood between the hi-tech world of cyberspace and the
mundane intricacies of a world of matter that was referred to as <em>in real life.</em> 
Immersed in the age of virtual realities and information spawned from the
complexities of electronic operating systems, he stood, a conduit rooted in a
concrete world of particulars known by empiricism's own definition, yet
lured by an attraction for potential that transcends an ephemeral genesis.</p>

<p> The room, where Slate worked at the shop, was sparse.  Assorted
books lined the make-shift shelf next to a cluttered desk.  Papers lie
scattered, yet there is the impression that each paper had been placed
deliberately, giving the semblance of order.  The blips and beeps of
computers were interrupted only by music, or the jarring ringing of a
telephone.  In one corner , almost inconsequential, is a cot.  The covers are
askew, intimating that someone has slept here.</p>

<p> Music provides movement of the mind, of the body.  Slate chose his
music carefully.  He learned to appreciate the harmony and the rhythm often
hidden to most initiates on the thresholds of a passion little understood.</p>

<p> The phone rings.</p>

<p> "Yeah, here.  What do you want to know?" Slate asked her.</p>

<p> "Uhm, I'm not sure," she countered.  She knew one could reveal much
just by the questions one asked.  Alicia was guarded, but she was curious. 
At odds with herself, still she had dared to make the call.  <em>Why do I wish
to know him?  What is this attraction that causes me to tremble?  Is it
possible  that I have found one who will know me? {One can only know
oneself.}  It trembles me to contemplate another whose eyes look beyond my
own.  One whose voice speaks in even tone offering without attempting to
control.  One who gives freely what is asked for.  That alone unnerves me! 
Be careful of what is asked for; you just might get it.</em></p>

<p><em> </em>"What do you do, may I ask?" Alicia said attempting to sound
polite, yet distanced.</p>

<p> "I work in a computer shop.  Next question?'</p>

<p>  <em>Whoa! That's direct,</em> she thought.</p>

<p> Suddenly, Alicia is confronted with her own purpose.  <em>Why did she
telephone him?  What did she hope to know?</em></p>

<p><em> </em>"Uhm, let's just put it this way; there's nothing I need to
know," she responded with an almost discernible sigh.</p>

<p> "OK," his reply.</p>

<p> "Er, is there anything you wish to know?" she queried.</p>

<p> Slate suppressed a chuckle.  There in the morning, all systems running
smoothly, a few minutes could be given to the audacious character whose
type interrupted his work window at definitely not scheduled times.  With his
eyes scanning the windows he leaned back in his chair listening to her voice
and noting the absence of background noise.</p>

<p> "I don't ask questions.  I listen.  I figure people will tell me what
they want me to know."</p>

<p> Alicia smiled.  <em>Wow!  It's a good thing I have a strong ego, or I
would be feeling pretty unimportant right now. Why?  I mean he didn't say
he didn't want to know me.  He answered directly.</em></p>

<p><em> </em>"There's nothing about me that you wonder about?" she asked with a
trace of incredulity about her.</p>

<p> "I wonder <strong>about</strong> a lot of things.  One of which is why you called?  I
have things to do, so I would be pleased if you'd either tell me what it is you
want, or end this conversation so I can get back to work.  I have better
things to do than spend time in idle chat that is mere entertainment for you,
and wasteful moments for me."</p>

<p>  <em>This is a bit too direct.  Even for somebody like me who prides
herself on telling-it-like-it-is speech. </em>But Alicia knew she was only
re-acting to her own insecurities when deciding to respond from her out of
'now  I've been challenged frame of reference.'  <em>Why challenged? Well,
anyone can see that the ultimate question is that of status which is directly
relevant to power.  His declaration stated emphatically that
<strong>he</strong> dictated the rules for dialectical engagement.</em></p>

<p>"State your purpose for calling, or hang it up."  Terse and to the point.</p>

<p> "I called because you gave me your telephone number, and your
permission to call,"  Alicia stated, her tone crisp, yet emphatic.</p>

<p> "You called for your own reasons.  What are those reasons?" Slate  
asked.</p>

<p> <em>Why can't I shed this need to engage this man in dialogue?  The
words I would speak</em> <em>right now belie this moment; cloak those very reasons
he is asking for.  Why won't he just play the damn  game? Gads! She had
said it: the Game.</em>

<p><em> </em>She was a teacher schooled in the finer points of the English language. 
Her work was words; indeed, she was her word.  Creative writing was the
course she enjoyed teaching most of all.  She was constantly amazed at what
persons kept within the depths of themselves.  A man will tell his English
teacher in an essay what he wouldn't tell his alter-ego!  Secrets found their
way before here eyes; eyes that had become keen and penetrating in their
silence, yet at times sparkle with the laughter of a pagan wench, a word she
loved.

<p> "You were saying..." interrupted her musings, pinning her to the
moment.

<p> "I don't know why," Alicia stated quietly.

<p> He smiled, and said nothing more.  She could hear his breathing, her
senses alert, guarded in the safety of silence.

<p> Softly, he offered, "Yes, you do.  I sense that you are searching for
words."

<p> His tone of voice surprised her.  She wasn't prepared for
understanding.  Indeed, she was unnerved by it.

<p> "Well...perhaps we can talk again sometime, " Alicia introduced in a
monotone meant to focus the attention away from her.

<p> "Sure," his monosyllabic reply.

<p> The click was followed by the drone of a dial tone.  She put the phone
down and sat still, staring into the emptiness of a severed connection.

<p>         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p> The boy grew up alone.  Somewhere along the way he'd learned
patience.  He could wait without expectation.  His mother would squeeze his
arms, hold him down in his crib, glare with force deep into his eyes; the
message: quiet!  No sound.  She'd turn,  the child already forgotten, walk out
of the  bedroom, shut the light, the door.  He lie silent, staring into the black,
the emptiness.

<p> Blond hair, green eyes shine.  He smiles the sweetest smile as he cocks
his head, appears to be listening to something only he hears.  His eyes shine. 
His smile is a response to something beyond our ken.  His smile --soft,
tender, is not meant to convey.  It is not a vehicle for reaching outward, nor
does it invite welcome.

<p> Once someone wrote a poem for him when he was two years old. 
She was struck by his angelic aura.  He reminded her of Plato's  universals;
his dreamy, shining eyes that smile, and the concentration when he listened to
rhythms only he heard.  She would hug him; hold him close.  He would smile
quickly, differently, then pull away gently, but purposefully.  She never knew
if she'd really touched him.  She realized his wasn't a painful existence.  He
never learned about emotion.  He wasn't touched in his first years.  He had
been his mother's doll and his daddy's shadow.

<p> He was always there, in the background.  He would sit on the floor
and play with his trucks.  But somehow the lady knew that his deep smile
and shiny eyes had nothing to do with what he was doing.  Every now and
then he would glance up at her and grin with those  great big wide eyes that
seemed to emit an almost unnatural shining.  There was an almost
imperceptible nod of his blond-white head as he looked directly at me.  No,
he looked directly into her.  It was almost as though they had an
understanding between them.  Almost as though he was humoring her!

<p> The lady wanted to take him into her arms in those days, and hold him
close.  She wanted to make up to him for all the feelings and emotions that
he'd been robbed of as a child, as a baby.  How she loved him!  She could
no more predict his future than deal with her own present.  In retrospect it is
no wonder that the lady felt such a profound kinship with the  boy.  Perhaps
fate was kinder to him, for he never knew comfort, or the feelings of
dependency towards others as she had known.  He was able to be alone with
himself.  The lady finds it difficult these days.

<p>             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~` 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p> The old lady sat on the porch of her large two story home.  From 
there, across the expanse of lawn bordered with hydrangeas and rose bushes
of various color, she could watch as an occasional car or logging truck
passed by.

<p> Scotch Broom  blossomed among Blue Oaks along the roadsides of
this small town in the heart of the Mother Lode gold country of Northern
California.  Kathleen, a large woman of Irish descent, only exhibited the
tracings of proud arrogance when she stated, without looking at her visitor,
that <em>her</em> family had lived in Old Georgia Slide; after which the town was later
founded.

<p> They sat on the porch.  Kathleen on one side of the stationary swing,
and Alicia on the other.  After dinner Alicia would cross the street from her
house, opening  the gate and walking to Kathleen's front door.  Somehow
opening that gate also brought a sudden calm and peacefulness.  Kathleen
didn't have many visitors these days.  Alicia felt that she had always
belonged here.  Kathleen's door was never locked, and Alicia was told that
there was no need to knock before entering.  She could hear her children
laughing in play, the dog barking as he chased after them.  She didn't worry
as the children were accustomed to her visits with Kathleen.  For an hour or
so each early evening she found herself sipping a cold drink and often a
small glass of wine which Alicia had poured for the two of them.  There was
a peacefulness in Kathleen's old-fashioned kitchen.  The portly old Irish
character had insisted they drink out of the delicate find crystal glasses she
kept reserved for the two of them.

<p> Kathleen spent most of her time sitting in the large rose-colored chair 

<p> in her living-room, just inside her front door.  A room where large windows
were covered in heavy white lace, yet of delicate design.  

<p> Alicia walked with the confidence of a strong-willed twenty-six year
old woman whose figure belied the fact that she had borne four children. 
Tight jeans, back pocket worn where she always kept her jackknife, often
caught the eyes of others.  The blue levi shirt, top buttons opened, didn't
hide the firm breasts that resented the constraint she was obliged to wear. 
Indeed, she often wished that nudity were the accepted trend, although she
knew her nature was one of personal shyness when it came to naked flesh.

<p> There was nothing particularly different about this day.  The familiar
creaking of the gate as she pushed it, and the clanging as it shut to rest within
the iron clasps was the prelude to her jaunty step as she looked at the
flowers.  Today the Holly tree seemed to look a brighter green, almost
glistening.  She stopped, turned and crossed the lawn to stand there..  The
tiny red berries seemed lush and full.  The edges of each shiny leaf seemed
sharp; the green appeared almost waxen.  There's a silence here that's felt; a
presence, as though the tree itself was aware of its spectator.  Alicia reached
out and touched one of the leafs.  She rubbed it with her thumb and
forefinger feeling the smoothness, feeling a strange connectedness.  For a
moment she stood in the silence of a new place.  There was no sound, no
feeling of space or permanence.  There was only the dark shining green and
the feel of something smooth.  

<p> Chuckling at herself, Alicia turned away abruptly and hurried towards
the front porch and door.  The swing was immobile and empty.

<p> Opening the door and entering, she noticed that Kathleen was sitting in
her chair, eyes closed, and the television on.  Alicia walked quietly in front of
her and sat in the wooden straight-back chair adjacent to her.  Television
didn't interest Alicia so she looked at the various figurines on the corner shelf
across the room.  She thought about this large white house and its upstairs
bedrooms.  Imagined the borders all gathering at the  round oak dining room
table where now  centered was a thin round, light green, glass vase that held a
bouquet of daffodils and lilies of the valley.  The scent of honeysuckle
drifted in subtle breeze as though nature had daubed a touch of perfume in
gay passing like a friendly send-off  to some great ball where festive dancing
beckons.  Honeysuckle lingers of an early evening and remains the scent of 
memories and stillness approaching the edge of evening...

<p> Some time had gone by, and Alicia  started to rise quietly from her
chair.

<p> "Where're you going?"  came the low gruff voice.

<p> "Oh, you're awake.  I was going to leave because I didn't want to
wake you."

<p> "Just because my eyes are closed, doesn't mean  I'm sleeping," was
the clipped reply.

<p> Alicia smiled to herself, and turned to look at Kathleen whose face
suddenly broke into a wide Irish grin, and eyes sparkling with merriment.

<p> Alicia busted out laughing.

<p> "I'll have to remember that one," she said chuckling.

<p> She looked as Kathleen struggled to lift her large body up out of her
chair.  Her knees, no longer able to hold her without the assistance of a cane. 
Alicia had learned a long time ago not to attempt to help her  rise.

<p> "I may be 89 years old, but I've never asked for a hand-out yet, and
I'm not starting  now." Kathleen had warned with that stern looking-into-your-eyes glare of a determined and proud woman.

<p> "Fine.  Remember that then the next time you get mad at me for not
hearing you when you fall and can't get back up!"  Alicia shot back, knowing
Kathleen secretly loved the fact that she didn't scare her at all.  Alicia giggled
to herself as she re-called how furious Kathleen was with her some time ago. 
Kathleen had gone into her backyard in search of fresh flowers when she fell. 
She had shouted for Alicia, until she couldn't lie there anymore.  Kathleen,
being a resourceful Irish gal, rolled herself down the gentle slope to her back
gate where she managed to pull herself up.  she will never forget the stern-eyed deadpan expression on Kathleen's face that night when she joined her
for their evening's chat.  

<p> Eyebrow sporting a little bandage, and elbow  scraped, Kathleen had
uttered in her low commanding tone "Where were you, when I needed you?"

<p> Alicia had seen Kathleen's slow grin as she turned and walked
laboriously through the dining room towards her kitchen.  It was a game they
always shared.  Alicia would pretend to be looking out the back window
over the sink while Kathleen reached behind a chair in the corner for the jug
of wine.  

<p> Early evening found two women sitting together on a porch swing. 
Each looking quietly inward, as they rocked with the taste of wine, the scent
of honeysuckle and images of the  shining green. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>.    

<p> Rain-blackened oak trees loomed over the steep river path.  Alicia
tossed her cigarette ahead of her, staring as the red glow landed in the dirt. 
Then, without an afterthought, she  ground out the fire fiercely with her bare
foot.  she made her way slowly, deliberately, towards  a patch of moonlight.

<p> Alicia smiled the merest trace of a grin as she jerked her pullover off,
tossing it up onto the rock beside her as the moonlight brought tiny flecks of
fire into her auburn hair.  She shuddered, cupped her breasts in her hands. 
Warm.  Then, with a chuckle, she snapped open her jeans, wriggling out of
them almost in one motion.  Naked, she stretched, content in her excitement,
and like her feline cousin, she strolls softly, searching for a pieces of fallen
timber to build a fire.

<p> There was a solemness about the naked girl totally alone with the river:
the water brushing against the rocks, shards of light dancing in the black
depths beside the huge boulder.

<p> Dropping her armload of firewood, alicia brushed the prickery cedar
slivers off her arm and breasts.  Deciding against building a fire, she lies on
the smooth rock.  Her body enjoyed the last traces of heat that the rock had
absorbed throughout the day.  She listened intently to the black silence
surrounding her and searching the dark for the familiar sounds that night
brings.  She heard only the steady rhythm of the river's song merging with
the warm night wind.  Turning her head slightly, she looks at the sky framed
with the silhouettes of tall pine and mysterious oak trees.  She begins to play
her mental game:

<p> "Cygnus, Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Vega, Aldebaron," she murmurs to
no one.

<p> Suddenly, tired of her little game, she rises.  Standing on the rock, she
looks down into the black water that gently urges at the granite, urging her. 
She laughs.  "Oh, Christ, why not?" she asks herself and dives into this quiet
edge of the river.  With sure steady strokes Alicia swims easily with the
current to free herself from the chill of her daring plunge.  Letting herself
float, she closes her eyes and allows her mind to wander in conversation
within herself.

<p> <em> Alicia, what are you doing here?</em>

<p><em>                    Can't anybody go for a swim?</em>

<p><em> But it's nearly midnight!</em>

<p><em>   So what?  What difference does time make?</em>

<p><em> But what would people say if they saw you out here, alone
swimming naked?</em>

<p><em>   I don't know.  What could they say? </em>she giggles to
herself. <em>Hell, I'd ask them to join me, </em>she thinks devilishly.

<p> <em>Why do you do these things?  You just don't act like everybody else. 
I mean, a woman your age just doesn't go swimming all hours of the night,
and naked!</em>

<p><em>   A woman my age?  So I've lived for twenty-six years, big
deal!  I do what I want to do and nobody can stop me.  Are there certain
time limits in life that only allows one to behave a certain way for a certain
specified moment, or minute, or month or year?</em>

<p><em> Alicia, you're sick.</em>

<p><em>   To Hell I am.  The rest of the world's sick, and I'm sick
of it, </em>she replies vehemently to herself.

<p> <em>No, the world isn't sick.</em>

<p><em>   What the Hell do you mean?  The whole world sits on
its ass and laughs at Archie Bunker.  Shit, they shoulda made him
President.  Then he could sit and laugh! </em>she giggles.

<p> <em>Oh brother!  Now I've heard everything.  The way you sum
everything up in one stupid, irrelevant statement.</em>

<p><em>   Everything's irrelevant.  Einstein said so.</em>

<p><em> Shut up, Alicia, and tune yourself out.  God you're dumb.</em>

<p><em>   So who knows what, anyway?</em>

<p><em> Help, she's nuts, I think.</em>

<p>She laughs, turning quickly she swims rapidly towards shore kicking the
water to break white in the moonlight behind her.  Her feet touch the rocky
river bottom as she rises near the river bank, and walks carefully, slipping
momentarily as steps on a sharp rock.  She regains her balance awkwardly,
then in a quick motion runs up onto the sandy beach.  shivering, she grabs
her clothes from the gray rock and dresses.  She hurries to arrange the
firewood she'd gathered.

<p> <em>Place the wood in a sort of teepee arrangement, light a match and
hope the wood will catch.  Damn! </em>She curses as the match burns her
fingers.{But can't help grinning as she watched herself leaning over her
perfectly formed wood pile, shivering and trying to start a fire.}  So, try
again, slowly.  A small stick begins to burn.  In a few minutes the sticks
begin to make the cracking sounds that send little shivers running along her
spine.  Alicia sits cross-legged before her fire watching the flames reach
upwards in long fingers as if to catch a bit of night sky.  Here eyes follow the
flames until the fire becomes a sort of slow motion ballet performing just for
her.  Suddenly, feeling the intense heat on her legs and face, she moves back
away from the fire where she can sit comfortably.  Gradually, she relaxes,
and with a sigh lies on her stomach and rests her head on her hands.

<p> <em>I should have been an Indian,</em> she muses.<em>  Why would anyone want
to live in an house once one has seen the sky and felt the earth?</em>

<p><em> Because the snow's wet and cold in winter, and makes a lousy
blanket, stupid, </em>an inner voice replies.

<p> <em>Oh, I'd have thought of something to survive, </em>she retorts angrily.

<p> <em>Yeah, you'd have had someone help you build one, and then you'd
get lonesome all cooped up all alone in your nice, warm house.  You'd
want someone for company, and then you'd want a few kids cause every
house has to have kids, and you'd be right there in a town nice and comfy
like everyone else, </em>came the disgusted reply.

<p> <em>I wonder if all women think in circles like I do? </em>She questions
herself.<em>  But then if I do <strong>everything</strong> I at least run the whole circle, </em>she
figures quite logically.  <em>Which means there's nothing half-way about my life,
and anyway that's what life is, a circle.  I know I'm right.  The only thing
that people up is stopping to look back upon the circle to see where one has
been.  That's it, keep your eyes in front and don't stop to look back.</em>

<p><em> </em>

<p><em> But what if someone calls you to wait; to stop and turn around? 
</em>That other voice again.

<p>   <em>Stop</em>, <em>but don't turn around.  Wait until the one calling</em>
<em>catches up with you</em>. <em> But</em> <strong><em>never, </strong>never turn around, </em>she states emphatically.<em>
And that's another thing, you sarcastic know-it-all...</em>

<p><em> I'm not listening to you anymore.  You keep trying to turn me
around, until you've got me going in circles within circles.  As Shakespeare
said, ...out damn voice, out! </em>she giggles.

<p> <em>O.K. I'm leaving.  I can't bear another one of your misquotes, gawd! 
It's 'out damn spot out.'</em>

<p><em>Ha! </em>Alicia exclaims triumphantly,  <em>Fooled you this time.   You've misquoted
it too.  But get lost anyway.  Besides, I want to think about Slate.   Now
there's  a man who knows what he wants, and does what he wants.  He
never looks back, and he knows how to laugh.  I mean the really down-to-earth deep laugh of a man that's really happy.  Taut muscles and a
sensuous walk, black hair and the devil peeking out of his eyes.  When
slate smiles he's giving you the whole damn world wrapped in sunshine
and flowers, and you thank him for it.</em>

<p>     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p> "Hey, Jude, let's go," Alicia remarked excitedly to her friend.

<p> "Where to?" Jude questioned, grinning up at Alicia.  The two women
always seemed to know each other's thoughts.  Jude sat, her long legs
crossed, and her head slightly bent.  Her straight brown hair brushing against
her guitar as she quietly strummed the notes of her favorite song, singing the
words softly to herself...

<p> "Close the door, don't whisper out my name..." Jude sang.

<p> "Whaddaya mean, where to?" giggled Alicia.  "Let's hit the dusty
road!"

<p> "What's the plan?"  A knowing smile playing on Jude's lips as she
asked.

<p> "You-know-who's in town.  Saw his truck parked by Merchie's
Garage.  Let's go see what Slate's up to.  Besides, I'm bored."  said Alicia
feigning a childish pout.

<p> "All right.  Let's take my car.  That thing you drive is a death trap,"
grumbled Jude.  "Damnit to hell, help me find my keys.  I left them right here
on the table, and they're gone."

<p> "You ought to tie them around your neck, Jude.  You never do know
where they are.  Did you look in your purse?  By some weird quirk of fate,
they might just be where they belong." Alicia replied with sarcasm tinged with
good-natured whimsy.

<p> "Oh, shut up, Alicia.  You'd lose your ass if I didn't keep an eye on
you," retorted Jude.

<p> Neither one would give up for fear of not having the last word.

<p> "Here they are," exclaimed Jude, "you're right.  The keys were in my
purse.  How do you suppose they got there?"  she asked seriously, almost to
herself.

<p> "What does my hair look like, Jude?"

<p> "Awful! No, it's all right, Jude smiled mischievously.

<p> "We're off!  Escape! Flight! Freeeeee!"  the two shouted gleefully,
slamming the cabin door behind them as they ran to the car.

<p> As they rode into town, they both saw the logging truck parked at the
side of the garage.  This truck appeared almost human; waiting patiently for
slate to take it home.  The giant mass of steel bore its burden of logs with
abject nonchalance. 

<p> "Smug looking bastard, isn't it?" uttered Jude.

<p> "Oh, I don't know, more like confident complacence I'd say," chided
Alicia.

<p> "Brother! You'd defend the Devil if someone even looked like he were
going to rib him."  Jude growled as she rolled her eyes.

<p> "Well, someone has to help the underdog," Alicia murmured.

<p> "Shit," cursed Jude, "someday you'll find out about life Alicia, and
when you do I hope you can take it.  When are you going to learn that
nobody gives a damn about anyone else when you come right down to the
nitty-gritty?"

<p> Alicia smiled a little sadly saying, "Perhaps you're right, but I don't
think so."  <em>Why wouldn't Jude let herself admit that she too cared about
people, about life?  So she's been hurt; we all hurt.  Jude, the girl who
lived for today and couldn't see tomorrow.</em>

<p><em> </em>Alicia, who believed in eternity, knew it existed, knew only that each
day the path full of pitfalls brought her closer.  Yea, climb the mountain, and
if you're tough enough you reach the top.  You find high ground, and you've
got it.  And Jude thinks she's the one with guts?  Hell, at least I'm taking on
the mountain.  She just sits at the bottom laughing at the fools who try to
scale  it.  But then, her hands aren't torn and bleeding.  Sing your songs, girl. 
Soothe the sorry ones who climb.  Perhaps, the world needs both of us.

<p> "Come on.  Let's go," Jude replied a little apologetically.  "Slate's in
his 'office' again."

<p> Alicia read the sign surrounded by the dim lights.  "<strong>Miner's Club</strong>",
she uttered as she pushed the door open defiantly.  The juke box wailed a
tune remotely familiar, but she focused upon the row of bar stools as she
studied the back sides of their occupants until her eyes stopped at the wide
shoulders leaning over the bar talking to the bartender.  She walked slowly,
unaware that she returned 'Helloes' and 'Hi's' as she passed by, until she took
a seat beside Slate.  She turned back to look for Jude, but she was already
sipping  a beer and talking to one of the loggers.

<p> "Hi," said Slate with a knowing grin that was penetrated with a wink.

<p> "Hi, Slate, what are you up to tonight?" as their eyes met and held
each other.

<p> The bartender, a shapely woman, petite with cascading black hair,
whom everyone called Pegg, watched them.  <em>Those two look like they know
a secret, and they're not telling, </em>Pegg mused to herself.  <em>Oh Hell, it takes all
kinds,</em> she remarks flippantly as she turns to Alicia.

<p> "Hi, gal, what'll you have?"

<p> "She'll have brandy and seven, and I'm paying," Slate retorts with a
sort of glaring look at Pegg.

<p> "All right!  I just asked, sweets," answers Pegg.

<p> "You're dressed up, wearing your rings, eye make-up.  Where're you
going?"  Slate questions in an attempt to sound casual.

<p> "To the river.  Invited creative writing class over at the college to meet
tonight and sit around the campfire, drink wine, solve the mysteries of the
ages.  Poetry is better at night," replied Alicia.

<p> "Well, maybe I'll drop by, " Slate remarks while looking straight ahead
into the mirror behind the bar as he takes a long drink of his brandy and
seven.

<p> <em>Oh no, Alicia thought trying not to reveal her panic.  He can't show
up there.  slate, self-confident, bold, unpredictable roaring up to their
campfire.  He was always trying to enter her world; trying to control her,
to figure her out.  She loved him for that, yet would resent any intrusion
upon her soul.  she was much like Slate.  Yet, she stayed within the
accepted parameters of the society she chose to live in.  In other words, she
played by the rules, in the daytime anyway.  At night, alone, she was
drawn to her primordial kinship with the elements.  Such powerful forces
of pure feeling, cosmic consciousness, the awful beauty.</em>

<p><em> </em>She smiled as she thought of Reubin's nickname for her.  "Fire."  Her
mentor knew her well.  She sensed it.  Yet, theirs was an unspoken
awareness.  Slate never mentioned Reubin's name, but she could feel the
power struggle.  Slate was the male protecting his territory: her.  But she
knew that was not the real issue.  She was merely the pawn in an ego struggle
that existed from the moment of human consciousness.  Well, she refused to
be a pawn in any game.  some day she would meet her soul-mate, her other
half.  She just knew it.  Once she thought Reubin was the one.  He was her
god for a time.  He touched her deeply.  She almost spoke.  She knew too
much; could almost subsume herself into another's consciousness.  Reubin
loved her.  He loved her deeply for a while, but couldn't accept her freedom
to remain her own identity.  Theirs would always be a very deep and intense
relationship.  Slate would never want her soul.  He didn't even care about
souls.  He liked to fuck, simple as that.  slate was a true hedonist.  He made
sex pleasurable, fun, good!  Slate didn't carry any hang-ups with him to lay
on his "partner."  With slate, sex is as natural as saying "Hi."  sometimes I
think his is an honesty that is truly rare, truly beautiful.  Slate always treated
Alicia like a lady.  He admired her wit and her sensuousness.  Alicia was
drawn to Slate.  "Chemistry.  It's chemistry," he once said.

<p> "But, we've been given a brain," remarked Alicia, mostly for her own
benefit.  She was puzzled, confused.

<p> She had noticed his frown.  A frown that was for himself; not to be
conveyed, shared.

<p> "What about love?" questioned Alicia.

<p> His reply, "I don't believe in love the way you do.  Falling in love,
getting to know someone is nice."

<p> "And falling out of love, sucks!" growled Alicia.

<p> She saw the hurt in his eyes.  It was remembered pain.  He'd been
burned bad once.

<p> "What is love?" Alicia asked quietly.

<p> "It's hormones and spending a lot of time together," he replied softly
with a smile.

<p> "I think it's more than that, Slate.  There's a permanence found in real
love that's beautiful.  It's poetry.  It's lasts forever.  I believe in all those
corny songs about eternity.  I believe when one finds that real love one
doesn't want to be with anyone else.  Love is, well, love is..." she seemed
lost in thought as she paused, groping for just the right words.

<p> "Love is hormones, sweets, and power.  The old power struggle
wrestled to exhaustion," grins slate as he leans over to look directly into
Alicia's eyes.

<p> "Someday I'll know love.  My kind of love, Slate, ole buddy. 
Meantime, falling in lust mixed up with a little like is ok, too," she teases.

<p> "A <strong>little</strong> like!" Slate roars.  "Honey, you're coming with me.  Come
on.  My truck's outside.  I'm going to show you a secret place that's nicer
than the river and spouting poetry.  Want to see my secret waterfall?" Slate
questions.

<p> <em>If she hadn't known him better, she'd have thought she'd heard the</em>
<em>merest trace of a pleading note  in his voice.  Perhaps he's not as tough as
he appears,</em> she mused. 

<p> "Come on, we're outta here."  Slate gets up quickly, puts his arm
around her shoulder holding her firmly, tightly but not demanding; more like
sweeping her along with his strength, his masculine confidence.

<p> Alicia smiled to herself.  She loved the feel of Slate's hard muscles
surrounding her as he whisked her out of Pegg's place and into his 4-wheel
drive pick-up that was parked by his logging truck.  Sometimes she enjoyed
feeling like the wench Slate made her out to be.

<p> Wench!  What a neat sounding word.  Made her feel gypsy-like, free,
and deliciously wild.  She sees herself running among a meadow of bright
wildflowers, the wind billowing her long full skirt.  She can almost feel the
touch of the wind against her up-lifted face as she runs, arms outstretched
teasing the elements.

<p> She leaned her back into the cool leather seat as Slate leaned forward
to start the truck.  He glances sideways at her, hesitates a moment as though
to say something.  Instead, he smiles, laughs.

<p> "We're off, baby-cakes.  I'm going to take you to my secret place.  No
one knows where this is.  When we get there, I'll show you what 'hormones
and a little like' is all about.  The old-timers knew these woods.  They knew
the earth.  People?  Well, they took a man by his word.  Maybe you've got
something there, Alicia, with all your books and poetry.  Words...guess
that's why I 'like' you.  You; can look me straight in the eye when you talk. 
You chose your words like I chose my women...very carefully."

<p> "Why Slate, I do believe you're waxing poetical, maybe even
philosophical,"  Alicia teases kindly.

<p> "Come here," Slate growls playfully as he puts his arm around her
shoulders and pulls her over next to him.

<p> She leans into the curve of his arm and rests her head back upon his
shoulder.  She allows her long legs the comfort of his jeans stretched tight
over strong leg muscles.</p>

<p><em>He gives me strength,</em>she muses as she relaxes in the pure joy of
his being.  They ride along in close silence.  They do not need to speak.</p>

<p> Slate stopped the truck deep into the forest.  He'd had to use 4-wheel
drive to arrive at his 'secret place.'  He'd made his own road to get to this
spot.  He leaned back against his seat watching Alicia as she looked out the
open window.  He studied her. <em> I could easily love her, </em>he thought.  <em>Naw,
too complicated.  We're a couple hawks.  Two hawks can't sit on the same
branch.</em>

<p><em> </em>"This is absolutely incredible.  Slate, how did you ever find
this spot so far off the road?"</p>

<p> He didn't answer.  He kept watching her as she was lost in the
moment.  She hadn't wanted an answer.  He watched quietly; allowed her
moment apart from himself.  <em>My god, she's so beautiful.  Her hair has fire
in it, seems alive.  Her nostrils flare slightly as she seems to almost
imperceptibly smell her surroundings.</em></p>

<p><em> She reaches out to touch the dashboard.  A gesture that seemed to be
reaching out for something unknown, yet sensed.  She is of the wilds She's
so alive.  We will never tame the wilderness, </em>Slate thought silently.  He
laughed out loud suddenly as his mind pictured trying to tame Alicia.  <em>Woe
to the one who tries,</em> he thought.</p>

<p> "What's so funny?" Alicia asks turning to look at Slate.</p>

<p> He noticed the slightly defiant tone in her voice, in the way she drew
herself back, acknowledging his presence, annoyed maybe at being brought
back from wherever her senses had taken her.</p>

<p> "I was just thinking what one Hell of a job some poor bastard is going
to have trying to hold onto you, girl." Slate answers quietly with laughing
eyes as he sat unmoving, his arm purposely relaxed around her shoulders.</p>

<p> Alicia smiled as she leaned comfortably, nestling into the curve of his
body.  She loved these quiet moments alone in the woods with Slate.  He
was most at-home in the woods.  Indeed, he was of the earth.  This was his
element; hers too.  Yet, each was different.  She sensed the mystical
murmurings of the past; could feel the magic before  and beyond time.  He
envisioned the toil, the sweat, the heartache of those who worked to build
their times, to realize their destinies.  He felt the presence of commitment,
dedication, of masculine perseverance through the ages.  His was a revered
appreciation of man's quest for permanence.  A permanence that all men
coveted in their world; that elusive permanence one could feel mocking man
through the ages.  He felt the awesome power every time he picked up a
chainsaw and watched the bark fly as the whining saw, chain turning, droning
and smoking, cut into the moist trunk of living trees.  It was then, sweating,
his aching muscles bulging as he stood firm, legs spread in balance to hold
his ground, or ready to spring away from sudden forces miscalculated, or
fate's intervention, should the tree  become what all loggers dreaded--a
widow-maker.  It was at these moments that he became part of that
permanence, that power.  But those moments were fleeting, such that one
was left wondering if one had felt anything at all: sudden awareness too
profound for certainty.  Reflection only validated the mystery.</p>

<p> The boy plays with his trucks, and the lady watches.  The boy listens
to the wind as he plays outside.  They walk together, the lady and the boy. 
He stops, cocks his head, listening...his eyes shine, as in a dream seeing what
others cannot. She watches as the boy 's head moves slowly upwards as
though he is being drawn to somewhere she is not.  He seems caught up in a
slow symphony heard by he alone.  The boy turns around slowly, his eyes
shining, as he speaks in a tone that is filled with awe, " Did you hear the wind
talking to the trees?"</p> 

<p>The lady smiled.</p>

<p> The two women would often spend their time together in laughter. 
The best times, though, were the times Kathleen spoke of old Georgia Slide.</p>

<p>Her eyes would become dreamy, and seem to look inward as she spoke of
the way of life back in them days.</p>

<p> It was during these times that Alicia would see the past.  These were
the times when she knew why she belonged here.  Kathleen sat on a swing
and shared the past with a woman who paused a moment and felt the dark
shining green.</p>

<p> The Game-Master entered the dreamhaze.  He could gather them up. 
Bring them to the edge of awareness.  He saw him there in the shop.  The
quiet one.  The one  with the will of iron and the heart of glass.  The one who
heard the music; who felt the symphony.  The  one who watches her, distant
, apart.</p>

<p> The Master of the Game can orchestrate a symphony of intricate
patterns and pathways for those who question, those who seek the answer.</p>

<p>The girl was aware of the Master of the Game.  She had known him once. 
Had come to Ur-Giger.  He had offered to be her guide.  They had traveled
a great distance.  Would she return to Principia? Or would he have to chose?</p>

<p>Game-Master , or conduit?</p>

<p>Slate pushed his chair back slightly.  Sighed, stretched, rose.  He put on
his latest CD, and reached for the phone...</p>
