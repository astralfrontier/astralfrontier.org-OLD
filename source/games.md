### Previous games

* **Dungeon World**: played several [Dungeon World] games with different groups.
* **Fairy Soul**: facilitated a playtest. A flip-a-card game that didn't run long enough to really gather data, but neat anyay. Tag: [fairy soul](/tags/fairy-soul/).
* **Flip-a-card**: facilitated a playtest. Ran one session of a generic fantasy combat against kobolds, and I think it worked well enough. Tag: [flip-a-card](/tags/flip-a-card/).
* **Grand Adventure**: facilitated a playtest. An iteration of some of the concepts from Inept Sorcerers, set in a world based on bright colorful JRPGs like Grandia. Tag: [grand adventure](/tags/grand-adventure/).
* **Inept Sorcerers**: facilitated, ran, played. A dinky comedy game about Schmendrick-style spellcasters exploding. Tag: [inept sorcerers](/tags/inept-sorcerers/).
* **Lady Blackbird**: played a few sessions of [Lady Blackbird]. We didn't much further than escaping captivity, but interesting anyway.
* **Star Wars: Rebel Ops**: played a custom PTBA hack of [Star Wars World]. I played a clone trooper named Backup, assisting some rebels.
* **The Wake**: playing [FAE]. PCs traveling in a fantasy world where dreams had become reality. Tag: [the wake](/tags/the-wake/).
