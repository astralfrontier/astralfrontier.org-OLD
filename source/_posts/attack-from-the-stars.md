This is a "fusion AU", or an alternate universe created by combining
and reconciling many movies, television shows, video games, and other
sources. The topic is "alien invasion": extraterrestrial creatures
coming to Earth, singly or in force, for the purpose of conquering or
co-opting humanity.

Age of Ancients (1,000,000,000 BCE to 1947 CE)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Alien civilizations rose, fell, and rose again before humans ever
dreamed of visiting the stars.

![LeviathanEnthrallmentTeam.png](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image13.png) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

The Leviathans are the oldest known intelligence. They evolved in
water. Leviathans were enormous in size and reminiscent of Earth's squid
in overall design. Multiple eyes, tentacles, and a rigid armored plate
system made them physically formidable, while an unexplained mental
power let them dominate lesser organisms. ^[[Mass Effect: Leviathan](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Leviathan)]

Like many races to come, the Leviathans fell victim to their own
creations, the synthetic Reapers, over a billion years before humanity
attained space-flight. Originally mandated to preserve life at all
costs, the Reapers entered an eternal cycle: allow new civilizations to
evolve, grow, and spread, then harvest them to create new Reapers. The
Reapers established the Mass Relay network, and the Citadel, as tools
for their continual processing of organic life throughout the
galaxy. ^[[Mass Effect: Reaper](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Reaper)]

The Leviathans were not wholly destroyed. Pockets of survivors erased
all signs of their presence from the galaxy using their technology and
mental influence. They created thralls from the lesser races of the
time, a "Supervision Army", that would protect their most secret hiding
places. They retreated to the deepest caverns of the oceans of forgotten
worlds, and brooded. They would be remembered only in myths and fables
told by successor races, known by names such as "the Protodeviln".
^[[Macross: Protodeviln](http://macross.wikia.com/wiki/Protodeviln)]

![breetai-azonia.png](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image9.png) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

Since the fall of the Leviathans, other races have fought back against
the Reapers and their cyclic purges of organic life. Some were
successful, others were not.

Nearly 500,000 years before human space-flight, a race of beings known
as the "protoculture" dominated the galaxy. They were the first
humanoids to evolve in the galaxy, and seeded it with life modeled on
their own. ^[[Macross: Protoculture](http://macross.wikia.com/wiki/Protoculture)]
In time, the Reapers came for them, and they created the Zentradi army,
a race of organic warriors, to defend themselves. ^[[Macross: Zentraedi](http://macross.wikia.com/wiki/Zentradi)]
Though the protoculture was eventually destroyed as a society, the Zentradi
were too numerous and too powerful to wipe out as well. These clone
warriors left the galaxy, searching for their enemy.

![maxresdefault.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image12.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

Surviving members of the protoculture's species branched out and
mutated, and their seeded descendants lived and flourished. By 150,000
BCE, a human-like race of such survivors called the "Forerunners" ruled
an empire of a million worlds thanks to their dominance of the Citadel
and the Mass Relay network. They in turn had wrested the galaxy from
their elder race, the "Precursors", an older and different survival of
the protoculture's humanoid species. ^[[Halo: Forerunner](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Forerunner)]

When the Reapers came for them, the Forerunners faced a complication:
the Flood, a malignant and perverted viral form of the Precursors
themselves. The Flood would assimilate any and all biomass, eventually
forming vast networked intelligences and mutating whatever life it came
in contact with, as a sort of biological reflection of the Reapers
themselves. This, the ultimate Precursor weapon against the Reapers of
their time, threatened to destroy the Forerunners in a final act of
vengeance. ^[[Halo: Flood](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Flood)]

![flood-thumbnail-708x398-051a8c0f98a84b49a828010da2d435a5.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image35.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

The Forerunners armed and fired their own answer to the problem: the
Halo Array. This devastating weapon brought an end to much sentient life
across the galaxy. The Reapers attacking their civilization were wiped
out, but the protoculture and its children no longer reigned.

By 68,000 BCE, a race called the Protheans emerged. Seeded by the
protoculture, they had taken a different evolutionary turn. They had
multiple eyes and nostrils, a thick carapace, and a unique genetic
structure. They had a mental power like the Leviathans, but one for
communicating and transmitting thought rather than dominating
it. ^[[Mass Effect: Prothean](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Prothean)]

Twenty thousand years later, the Reapers came again. The Protheans had
learned of the Halo Array and used its advanced design in the
construction of a new weapon, called the Crucible. They were unable to
construct it in time, due to the vast resources it would require.
Instead, they entrusted the schematics to the future, storing them in a
repository on the planet Mars, just prior to their own
fall. ^[[Mass Effect: Crucible](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Crucible)]

![The-Prothean-mass-effect-3-29578058-1920-1080.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image23.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

The Flood was more subtle with the Protheans than with the Forerunners.
The Graveminds, the guiding intelligences of the Flood, kept Flood
infestations to a minimum. Undetectable infection, rather than waves of
created drones, spread across the stars on Prothean starships. When the
last Protheans came to Mars to bury their secrets, some samples of the
infection came with them. And when a chunk of Mars was ejected toward
Earth in 35,000 BCE, the Flood's spores went too, in the form of a
"black oil". ^[[X-Files: Fight the Future](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheXFilesFightTheFuture)]

Circa 20,000 BCE, the Supervision Army of the Leviathans was alive and
well. A genetically engineered race drawn from Leviathan DNA and
possessing their mental dominance power, called the "Ur-Quan", were
steadily building an invasion force they called the Hierarchy by
capturing and brainwashing aliens. ^[[Star Control](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl)]

Circa 3,000 BCE, a race of "Gems", silicon-based lifeforms who project
humanoid bodies with advanced psychokinesis, come to Earth with the
intent of creating more of their kind and transforming Earth into a
colony world. They are thwarted by an insurgent faction more interested
in preserving Earth life. The insurgents manage to drive the invasion
force back home, cutting off their access to the planet, then remain for
the next several millennia. ^[[Steven Universe](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse)]

Age of Invasion (1947 - 2012)
------------------------------

Earth's interaction with alien life during this time is dominated by
three factions: the Reticulians, the Mor-Taxans, and the Hierarchy.

![XFilesGrey.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image18.jpg) {.ui .small .right .floated .image}

The Reticulians are a race of large-eyed, gray-skinned aliens. Their
biochemistry is not based on carbon. They are cautious, cunning, and
manipulative. They have been partially taken over by the Flood, and
their mission is to colonize and hybridize other life-forms in
preparation for the Flood's resurgence. ^[[X-Files: Reticulian](http://x-files.wikia.com/wiki/Reticulian)]

![War\_worlds\_spielberg\_43\_x.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image10.jpg) {.ui .small .left .floated .image}

The Mor-Tax are aliens with a strongly trilateral symmetry: three arms,
each with three fingers, and a three-lobed eye on a neckless head.
Physically they are closer to jellyfish than mammals. They are
emotionless, dispassionate, and organized in a caste structure. Their
goal on Earth to secure the secrets of the
Protheans. ^[[War of the Worlds: Mor-Taxan](http://waroftheworlds.wikia.com/wiki/Mor-Taxan)]

![star\_control\_kohr\_ah\_ur\_quan\_by\_dczanik-d2z6mty.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image11.jpg) {.ui .small .right .floated .image}

The Hierarchy is the cluster of races held in thrall by the Ur-Quan
"masters". Each race has different strengths and weaknesses, but all
work together to facilitate invasions of other
planets. ^[[Ur-Quan Hierarchy](http://wiki.uqm.stack.nl/Ur-Quan_Hierarchy)]

### Arrival

The Reticulians and the Mor-Tax were both aware of the Prothean presence
in the Solar System millennia ago, and were convinced that the Protheans
may have hidden something on Earth.

The Reticulians begin to scout the Earth. In 1947, a fault causes one of
their stealth ships to fail and crash over Roswell, New Mexico. The
United State's armed forces immediately seize control of the wreckage
and begin to analyze it. What they discover alarms the American
government.

Several secret programs are initiated to deal with this new alien
threat. These include Black Mesa, Project 9, and Majestic 12. Black
Mesa's charter is the study of the exotic physics and anomalous
materials used to construct the Reticulians' craft. Project 9 studies the
aliens' biology. Majestic 12 is assigned to creating cover stories,
falsify or distort news reports, and otherwise manage the public
relations concerning aliens.

In 1952, a group later called "the Syndicate" is organized within the
State Department. The Syndicate's initial responsibility is to
coordinate the activities of the secret programs, and to collate their
results. Over the next two decades, what they learn, and their relative
lack of oversight, will increasingly isolate them from the national
interest.

![MV5BMTIyMzg1ODMxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE1NzY2MQ@@.\_V1\_CR0,30,250,141\_AL\_UX477\_CR0,0,477,268\_AL\_.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image40.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

The government's preparations pay off in 1953, when the Mor-Taxans land
in Grover's Mill, New Jersey and begin their invasion of America using
giant mechanical tripods. ^[[War of the Worlds](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarOfTheWorlds)]
The Syndicate launches a biological counter-attack using a substance called
the "black oil", discovered in the Reticulian wreckage. The Mor-Taxans
are captured and sealed away in steel barrels filled with the oil.
Unfortunately, their unique biology began to adapt to it, even gaining
some of the Flood's ability to infect other life-forms.

By 1956, these adaptations are complete. A handful of Mor-Taxans stored
on an Army base near Santa Mira, California escape their containers.
They begin infiltrating human hosts, intent on conquering humanity from
within. This attempt is thwarted by a few brave citizens such as Dr.
Miles Bennett, who reveals his findings to the
FBI. ^[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InvasionOfTheBodySnatchers1956)]
This prompts the Bureau to open
a set of files on incidents which could be due to alien action, dubbed
the "X-Files".

![the-roswell-conspiracies.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image15.jpg) {.ui .medium .left .floated .image}

Elsewhere in the world, other governments are secretly preparing for
the alien threat, which they became aware of through spies in the
American government. A secret group called the Global Alliance is put
together to keep the existence of aliens secret, and to hunt aliens who
interfered with humanity. ^[[The Roswell Conspiracies](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RoswellConspiracies)]
It is joined by luminaries such as Professor Bernard Quatermass, whose British
Rocket Group analyzes an alien device in 1958, found buried under
London, and finds evidence of prehistoric tampering with human beings in
an attempt to give them psychic powers. ^[[Professor Quatermass](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Quatermass)]

The Reticulians, meanwhile, send a second expedition back to Earth. They
manage to learn about the Syndicate's existence and open a dialogue with
key members. The Syndicate is shown enough of the gray aliens'
capabilities to become convinced that Earth could not survive a
concerted alien invasion. By 1973, the Syndicate is operating
independently of the State Department's oversight, forming a shadow
government that prepared to facilitate, rather than oppose, the
invasion.

![s-l1000.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/s-l1000.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

Colonel Ed Straker's car is driven off the road by alien attack
to prevent him from bringing evidence of alien activity to the authorities.
He survives the attack and manages to convince world governments
that existing response teams are insufficient to deal with the threat.
Aliens capable of shapeshifting, mind control, or body possession
make current security screening processes inadequate.
In addition, some governments privately distrust the presence
of aliens operating within Global Alliance.
As a result, a new organization, SHADO, is created and funded.
It will be a "backup" or "shadow" alien-hunting organization.
^[[UFO](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UFO)]

In 1982, a Norwegian Antarctic base sends out personnel who get too
close to a Reticulian secret base buried under the ice. It is destroyed
by a shapeshifting creature, possibly a sample of the Flood, who then
almost completely destroys a nearby American outpost. ^[[The Thing](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThing1982)]

By 1984, SHADO's organization is fully operational,
with submarines, satellites, and a secret moon base tracking alien activity.
Commander Straker's private life is a mess due to the oppressive security
requirements of keeping SHADO from being infiltrated,
but his organization is efficient and secure.

In 1987, American commandos on a mission to rescue a VIP from a jungle
prison encounter an unknown alien life form, which apparently takes
pleasure in stalking them. ^[[Predator](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator)]

### Awakening

In 1988, a terrorist action on an Army base manages to unseal several
Mor-Taxans. They promptly take over the terrorists' bodies and resumed
their invasion plans. A small group consisting of Harrison Blackwood,
Colonel Paul Ironhorse, computer expert Norton Drake, Dr. Suzanne
McCullough, and her daughter Debi, worked to uncover, understand, and
oppose the Mor-Taxans' actions. ^[[War of the Worlds](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WarOfTheWorlds)]

![They-Live.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image4.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

Thanks to the work of the Blackwood Project, a pair of specially
treated sunglasses is produced that will reveal human beings occupied or
controlled by Mor-Taxans to the wearer. The team distributes these to
every location where they've charted the aliens' activity. One of the
recipients of these sunglasses, an itinerant blue-collar worker, is
shocked by what he sees. He goes on the run as the aliens discover he
can see them, eventually taking a hostage and being betrayed. He manages
to destroy a crucial transmitter used by the Mor-Taxans to transmit
their hypnotic influence throughout Los Angeles. ^[[They Live](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheyLive)]

A city-wide panic is barely averted by Majestic 12, working with the
Reticulians, but the revelation of the Mor-Taxans allows Majestic and the
Syndicate to complete Blackwood's mission and wipe the aliens out
completely.

![Mulder-Scully.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image5.jpg) {.ui .medium .left .floated .image}

FBI special agent Dana Scully is assigned to long-time X-Files
researcher Fox Mulder in 1994. Together, the pair spend the next several
years researching mysterious cases, including the prior alien
incursions. ^[[X-Files](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles)]
Some of their information comes from abductee claims made by individuals such as
Travis Walton, who reported being taken to an alien spacecraft and
having horrific experiments performed on him. ^[[Fire in the Sky](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FireInTheSky)]

In 1995, Mulder and Scully investigate an effort by the Syndicate to
create human-Reticulian hybrids, who will help facilitate the aliens'
takeover of Earth. One of these, created by Project 9, is dubbed "Sil".
She escapes her holding facility and is driven by instinct to attempt to
mate with human beings and reproduce. She is eventually killed by the
team assigned to track her, including  Dr. Stephen Arden, Dr. Laura
Baker, Dan Smithson, and Preston Lennox. ^[[Species](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Species)]

![Species.1995-movie-1.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image25.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

The Global Alliance has managed to deal with isolated alien
disturbances - the result of other species' interest in the Reticulian
and Mor-Taxan presence on Earth - but are unable to infiltrate or
interfere with these races' activities.

### X-COM

As of 1997, UFO sightings have been increasing steadily, and the Global
Alliance's best intelligence shows "something big" coming soon, thanks
to an analysis of signals by astronomer Zane Zaminski. ^[[The Arrival](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheArrival)]
In 1998, they invite members of the Blackwood Project,
the Project 9 tracking team, selected FBI special agents,
and other individuals to join a new organization.
Their charter remains the same: investigate, contain, or eliminate alien
threats. This new organization is known as X-COM and will work
semi-openly with the government. ^[[X-COM](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom)]

The Hierarchy begins its invasion of Earth with the first of three
waves. This wave, led by the Gua species, arrives in 1997. The Gua don't
physically exist on Earth; instead, they clone "husks" from human DNA,
implanting them with alien tech, and transfer their consciousness into
the husks. They begin experimenting with humans to determine their
vulnerabilities, but also to probe for Prothean secrets or evidence of
Flood contamination. ^[[First Wave](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FirstWave)]

![MV5BMzM3MDYxNTYwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg0MjUzMDE@.\_V1\_SX640\_SY720\_.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image20.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

Reformed thief Cade Foster, one of the Gua test subjects, escapes
confinement. He is framed for the murder of his wife - really a Gua husk -
and goes on the run. Elsewhere, Gua experiments on high school
populations are disrupted by unlikely alliances between different
cliques of students. ^[[The Faculty](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFaculty)]

Cade Foster manages to get in contact with X-COM and inform them of the
existence of the Gua. Mulder and Scully finally learn the truth after
pursuing the Foster case themselves. Following further leads, the two
agents independently uncover a Reticulian spacecraft in Antarctica. The
Reticulians, now knowing the Hierarchy is coming, launch their
spacecraft, taking with it numerous hybrid experiments and aliens, and
abandon the Earth. ^[[X-Files: Fight the Future](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheXFilesFightTheFuture)]

### The Second Wave

![510531.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image17.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

The Gua abandon their efforts at infiltration once they have been
discovered, and send out a call to the Hierarchy. In 1999, the Second
Wave arrives. The Hierarchy's fleet of massive starships - the largest
on par with Earth's moon - enters Earth's orbit. The ships attack major
population centers in a devastating bombardment.

The Syndicate, abandoned by their Reticulian allies, takes a gamble and
hands over the alien data it has been collecting since 1947. Based on
this data, the President authorizes a nuclear strike, but it is
ineffective due to the Hierarchy ships' force fields.

With the help of Guan traitors sympathetic to the human cause, the
X-COM team at Area 51 is able to supply access codes that will unlock
the shields of the motherships. David Levinson and Captain Steven Hiller
are instrumental in delivering a nuclear device to the fleet mothership
in one of the Hierarchy's own fighter craft, using these access codes to
bypass the shields. The destruction of the mothership, and other ships
in the fleet, ends the immediate threat of Earth's
destruction. ^[[Independence Day](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay)]

![5531442823\_33ac9983cb\_b.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image16.jpg) {.ui .medium .left .floated .image}

Several of the Hierarchy's other alien races have already landed. X-COM
is mobilized to deal with these forces. One minor species, for whom
water is acidic, is apparently sent to Earth as a joke by the Ur-Quan
masters, who also used their psychic powers to compel human beings to
create crop circles as signals for them to follow. ^[[Signs](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Signs)]

One of the damaged Hierarchy ships soft-lands on South Ataria
island.Scientists begin an immediate program to salvage and repair it,
dubbing it the "Super Dimension Fortress", or SDF. ^[[Macross](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross)]

### Black Mesa

In 2003, a member of the Syndicate known as the "G-Man" obtains a
sample of the SDF's space-fold engine. This sample, known alternately as
fold quartz or Xen crystal, allows faster-than-light travel through an
interstitial space.

![half-life-2-gordon-freeman-620x620.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image22.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

The G-Man brings the sample to Black Mesa for analysis by the Anomalous
Materials laboratory. This results in a resonance cascade which opens
dimensional portals from Earth to another place and critically damaging
much of Black Mesa's infrastructure. Many personnel are killed or
trapped. Only one scientist, Dr. Gordon Freeman, is able to escape the
chaos.

As a result of the resonance cascade, an extradimensional faction of
aliens known as the Nihilanth send their foot soldiers - headcrabs,
vortigaunts, and other creatures - through dimensional portals opened by
the cascade. ^[[Half-Life](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife)]

X-COM's HECU (Hazardous Environment Combat Unit) is dispatched to Black
Mesa to contain the situation and deal with the alien presence. Thanks
to the G-Man, they are erroneously informed that the scientists at Black
Mesa were deliberately attempting to create a dimensional breach and
facilitate an invasion of Earth. The HECU is unprepared for the
outpouring of creatures from the portals, and only Corporal Adrian
Shephard is the only survivor of his unit. He witnesses Dr. Freeman
crossing the dimensional barrier in the Lambda Complex of Black Mesa.

Dr. Freeman enters the "border world" of Xen, fighting the Nihilanth's
forces using military weaponry supplied by the Lambda team. He is able
to kill the master Nihilanth whose energies were maintaining the portal
storm, closing the portals and preventing an immediate invasion of
Earth.

Black Mesa itself is destroyed by a nuclear bomb set by the G-Man. Both
Dr. Freeman and Corporal Shephard are abducted by the G-Man, and no
trace of them can be found.

X-COM speculates that the Syndicate was attempting to negotiate with
the Nihilanth through the G-Man, hoping to use them as a counter to the
Hierarchy's invasion. The resonance cascade was a way to allow the
extradimensional aliens' forces to enter Earth, but when the Syndicate
found that the Nihilanth had no intention of cooperating, they destroyed
the facility.

### The Zentradi

![Battle-Los-Angeles-PC-Game-features.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image37.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

By 2009, the world is actively preparing for another attack. However,
X-COM was built for counter-insurgency and special operations, rather
than all-out warfare. Their technologies, data, and training are now
integrated into a larger, international standing army. The result is UN
Spacy - the United Nations Aerospace navy and marine force.

Survivors of the earlier waves of invasion are debriefed using
hypnosis, and their stories are studied and correlated by government
psychologists in the hope that useful intelligence will emerge. Many of
their stories include mention of certain animals or distinct
odors. ^[[The Fourth Kind](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFourthKind)]

![0f21f0349462cacdc5796990d37760ae\_567x210.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image33.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

The SDF is ready to launch after a decade of work. On launch day, the
alien ship's sensors register a space-fold. According to the databanks
of the SDF's computers, the newcomers are known as the Zentradi - the
ancient cloned warriors of the protoculture - and have come in search of
their enemies, the Hierarchy. Despite its rebuild by humans, the SDF is
still considered an enemy.

To lead these hostile newcomers away from Earth, the SDF tries to
execute its own space-fold to the far side of the moon. Instead, the
ship and a complement of 70,000 civilians - the town that had sprung up
on South Ataria island to work on the rebuild effort - travel instantly
through space to the planet Pluto. Fortunately, the Zentradi
followed.

For the next two years, the SDF, dubbed "Macross" by its inhabitants,
successfully fended off Zentradi attacks. To combat the 60-foot Zentradi
clone soldiers, they use alien "overtechnology" to create advanced
aerospace fighter jets that can transform into humanoid robots.
Initially they are forbidden from returning to Earth and bringing the
Zentradi threat back to humanity's homeworld.

![EdgeOfTomorrowMimic.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image32.jpg) {.ui .medium .left .floated .image}

In 2011, the Third Wave of the Hierarchy comes to Earth. Aliens in
biomechanical suits attack major cities like Los Angeles, and encounter
opposition from UN Spacy's marine forces. ^[[Battle Los Angeles](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleLosAngeles)]
Elsewhere, other aliens use hypnotic blue beams to hypnotize and teleport
humans away for forced conversion into biomechanical components
of the alien war machine. ^[[Skyline](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyline)]
Mysterious energy-eating aliens land in Moscow and begin disintegrating the populace, with a few
survivors managing to evacuate via submarine. ^[[The Darkest Hour](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkestHour)]
Navies engage the aliens in the open ocean, notably the USS John Paul Jones which
manages to destroy an alien flagship. ^[[Battleship](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Battleship)]
A few unintelligent but vicious alien parasites land in places like Brixton,
to be fended off by local street gangs. ^[[Attack the Block](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackTheBlock)]

![Edge-of-Tomorrow-Reviews-Starring-Tom-Cruise-and-Emily-Blunt.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image31.jpg) {.ui .medium .left .floated .image}

The most powerful aliens in the Third Wave are called the "mimics",
monstrous and polymorphous aliens with an uncanny ability to anticipate
human battle strategy. By this time, the "mecha" technology used by the
SDF has been miniaturized to such an extent that rank-and-file soldiers
can be equipped with armed exoskeletons, or "Jackets". Using these
Jackets, and a mysterious property of the mimic blood that allows the
affected person to mentally travel backwards in time, soldiers William
Cage and Rita Vrataski are able to locate the master "Omega" mimic and
destroy it. With the source of their time-winding powers destroyed, the
tide is turned against the mimics. ^[[Edge of Tomorrow](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EdgeOfTomorrow)]

Age of Destruction (2012 - 2050)
---------------------------------

If the Zentradi are the enemies of the invading army, commanders
reason, maybe they will aid humans in fighting off the invasion. The SDF
is finally permitted to return to a war-torn Earth in 2012, and the
Zentradi follow.

On December 21st, the Zentradi devastate the Earth's surface in a
massive attack, which wipes out the majority of the Third Wave's
remaining forces but also does considerable damage to human
infrastructure and takes many human lives.

![189cymvy1s3xjpng.png](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image19.png) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

The Macross crew have discovered something about their Zentradi
enemies: they have no culture of their own, and they revere the
protoculture. Using common human emotions and emotional gestures -
music, kissing, and expressions of love - they cause many Zentradi
soldiers to become sympathetic to their cause. A few friendly commanders
realize that humanity is itself descended from the protoculture and
switch sides. Together, they create a plan to stop the larger Zentradi
armada from completely eradicating Earth. Using this plan, the Macross
and the allied Zentradi manage to wipe out the rest of the armada.

Despite the peace, humanity is unwilling to fully forgive or accept the
Zentradi for their genocidal actions, despite the good intentions of the
turncoat giants. The Zentradi ask for human volunteers to come with them
and teach them culture, and with these volunteers, they fold out of the
solar system.

![pacific-rim-kaiju-meets-pilots.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image3.jpg) {.ui .medium .left .floated .image}

Many of the Hierarchy's ships have crash-landed on Earth but are
somewhat intact. In 2013, the forces of the Nihilanth on the border
world of Xen use one of these ship's fold engines to open a dimensional
breach in the Pacific Ocean. They send gigantic biologically engineered
monsters, called "kaiju" by the humans, through this breach to attack a
war-ravaged and exhausted humanity. ^[[Pacific Rim](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim)]
The first emerge of a kaiju is later known as "K-Day", and is documented by citizen
journalists such as Hudson Platt. ^[[Cloverfield](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cloverfield)]

By 2015, conventional military forces have proven thoroughly
ineffective against kaiju incursions. This "Small War" causes military
planners to rethink their approach. They turn to the SDF and the alien
overtechnology, taking their robotic creations as a model. They build
gigantic non-transformable robots, called "Jaegers", operated by two or
more pilots operating in a neural handshake with each other. The defense
contractor Aperture Science provides its expertise with artificial
intelligence to control the Jaegers, and its study of the space-fold
engine and related "portal" technology is vital in understanding how to
close the breach.

![3182067-pacific-rim-robot.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image2.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

The Jaegers prove effective, temporarily. However, the rate of kaiju
incursions steadily increases, to the point that they are destroying
Jaegers faster than they can be built. In 2025, only a handful of
Jaegers are left, under the command of Marshal Stacker Pentecost. He
assembles a team of pilots for a last-ditch effort to close the breach.
Pilots Raleigh Becket and Mako Mori are able to penetrate the breach and
detonate the Jaeger "Gipsy Danger"'s nuclear engine in the middle of
Xen. The two pilots return through the breach to safety, but Marshal
Pentecost and his co-pilot Chuck Hansen are lost operating "Striker
Eureka" to cover their run.

The SDF's misaimed fold, plus the potential of another invasion force
from alternate dimensions, leads governments to seal away use of the
space-fold engine.

In 2041, it is discovered that the Nihilanth sent through numerous
smaller forces in addition to the kaiju, and that these have been
building up military bases under the ocean. UN Spacy comes under attack,
but defeats them within a few years. ^[[X-COM: Terror From the Deep](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XcomTerrorFromTheDeep)]

2045 marks the centennial of the second World War and the end of alien
hostilities on Earth. Mankind, shattered, exhausted, but alive, makes a
collective decision: It's time to take the fight to the stars.

Age of Expansion (2045 - 2115)
-------------------------------

The next seven decades see humanity spreading throughout the solar
system and preparing itself to meet the next visiting race.

By 2050, colonization of the solar system proceeds in earnest. Lunar
bases and orbiting factories are set up as launch pads for the other
planets. Research begins on faster-than-light technology that doesn't
depend on the space-fold drive.

![hqdefault.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image38.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

The American STARCOM (Star Command) program is formed in 2055 as a
military-scientific organization, separate from UN Spacy, and operating
in space and using combined arms and advanced technology. They
experiment with a limited version of the space-fold engine, called
"transtar". Their biggest enemy is not an alien force, but a mad
scientist who calls himself "Emperor Dark", and makes use of alien
technology provided by an unidentified
species. ^[[STARCOM](http://futurewarstories.blogspot.com/2011/09/msf-oddities-starcom-us-space-force.html)]

In 2059, a mysterious constellation of fold portals opens over Earth,
and an insect-like alien species emerges for a few minutes. They
disappear as quickly as they came. ^[[Macross Frontier](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier)]

Armstrong Outpost becomes UN Spacy's biggest military base on the Moon,
centered on the Shackleton Crater. It is inaugurated in 2069, a century
after man first went to the Moon, and becomes the capital of Luna
shortly thereafter.

In 2070, billionaire Victor Manswell, CEO of the Union Aerospace
Corporation, becomes frustrated with the pace of human exploration. He
begins preparing his own expedition. UAC contracts with UN Spacy to
research space-fold technology on an isolated research station on the
Martian moon of Phobos.

![doom\_alt\_boxart.0.0.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image29.jpg) {.ui .medium .left .floated .image}

Teleportation experiments between Phobos and Deimos initially appear
promising. A disastrous accident overtakes the Phobos base in 2072, and
forces brought through the space fold kill or mutate almost everyone in
the facility. The only survivor is an anonymous UN Spacy marine, who
fights his way through the hordes of altered creatures to shut down the
experiment. ^[[Doom](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Doom)]

Despite this setback, the Manswell Expedition departs in 2075, bound
for the Alpha Centauri system. They will not be not heard from for over
a century. Speculation at the time that the space fold drives
malfunctioned or went off course renews determination not to use the
technology until it is better
understood. ^[[Mass Effect: Manswell Expedition](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Manswell_Expedition)]

In 2080, the United Nations institutes organizational changes to UN
Spacy. The Manswell Expedition exposed a weakness in how the military
interacted with private corporations. The new organization, modeled on
STARCOM's success and given the similar-sounding name "Star Control",
will not only defend the Earth, but the solar colonies, and will be more
self-contained and less dependent on private
contractors.

Decades prior, scientist Hsien Ho led a project to create
"androsynths", a synthetic humanoid that would aid mankind in rebuilding
a shattered planet. In 2085, an androsynth rebellion is put down, but
numerous androsynths are unaccounted for, and it is widely believed that
they folded out of the solar system. ^[[Star Control](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl)]

![prometheus.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image21.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

In 2093, the Weyland Corporation follows Manswell's example, and
secretly sends the science ship "Prometheus" to distant world LV-223.
Aboard is corporate founder Peter Weyland, the androsynth "David 8", and
a complement of scientists including Dr. Ellie M. Shaw. Their goal is to
discover the source of the "black oil" and perhaps trace the origins of
life on Earth. LV-223 is one of three moons located in Zeta Reticuli,
the home constellation of the Reticulians that dealt with the Syndicate.
The expedition is also never heard from
again. ^[[Prometheus](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Prometheus)]

In 2103, the European Space Agency's Lowell City becomes the first
permanent human settlement on Mars. Located in Eos Chasma, the site
seems ideal at first. However, satellites and local observations in the
area give unusual readings, and strange phenomena earn the area a
reputation for being "haunted". ^[[Mass Effect: Mars](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mars)]

![zq3gtmm3t9ksh3linwld.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image1.jpg) {.ui .small .right .floated .image}

Inspired by the old stories of the Global Alliance and their "Roswell
conspiracies", the son of Lowell City's Mayor Jones assembles a few
friends, and a caniform androsynth companion, to investigate haunting
rumors in the hope of discovering new forms of alien
life. ^[[Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryIncorporated)]

In 2112, Ceres Base is constructed by Star Control. This marks the
largest space-borne military outpost, and the current extent of
humanity's colonization.

Age of Alliance (2115 - 2186)
------------------------------

During this era, humanity becomes an active participant in galactic
politics. Distrustful of aliens due to the repeated invasions of Earth
and the rest of the solar system, most of man's interactions with other
races proceed from a martial posture.

![new\_alliance\_of\_free\_stars\_by\_spacecoyote.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image30.jpg) {.ui .small .right .floated .image}

In 2115, the Chenjesu arrive in the solar system. They are a race of
silicon, crystalline beings, with advanced technology and high
intelligence. They are aware of the Hierarchy's invasion of Earth in
1999, and offer humanity a place in the "Alliance of Free Stars", which
intends to combat the Hierarchy and their Ur-Quan
masters. ^[[Star Control](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControl)]

After a few weeks of deliberation, and system-wide voting, humans join
the Alliance. They join the Chenjesu, the Mmrnmhrm (mechanical
beings from the Virginis constellation), the Yehat (a pterodactyl-like
race), the Shofixti (marsupials uplifted by the Yehat), and the Syreen
(a blue-skinned race of psychic humans).

![USCSS\_Nostromo\_002.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image6.jpg) {.ui .medium .left .floated .image}

The Nostromo, a cargo spaceship carrying raw materials for
the war effort, disappears after investigating a signal on planet
LV-426. ^[[Alien](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien)]
Hierarchy interference is thought to be responsible.

By 2126 the Alliance is ready for war. Humans contribute material and
labor, while the other races provide technological assistance. The next
eight years is a melee of between the Alliance and the Hierarchy. Many
battles are won, and many are lost. Ultimately, the Hierarchy is driven
out of the spiral arm. The cost is high: the Alliance has disintegrated.
Each race has lost too much, and lacks the political will to continue
participating. Humanity is left to fend for itself.

![Mass\_Relay\_Loading\_Screen.png](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image24.png) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

The construction of Gagarin Station begins in 2143. This facility,
located beyond Pluto's orbit, is the next attempt to master space-fold
technology and solve the mysterious repeat disappearances of fold drives
and sometimes the ships carrying them.. After five years, the
researchers pinpoint the cause of the interference: emanations from
Mars, and Charon, Pluto's largest moon - in reality a gigantic apparatus
called a "mass relay", a gateway to the stars.

Researchers uncover the Prothean cache on the Red Planet, and begin to
unravel the secrets of element zero, or "eezo". A year later, the Charon
Mass Relay is activated for the first time. Extrasolar colonization is
now in man's hands.

That year, 2149, marks the signing of the Systems Alliance charter.
While the United Nations represents all nations on Earth, the Systems
Alliance will represent all of Earth's colonies throughout the
galaxies.

The mass relays open the door to human colonization of nearby systems.
The Delta Pavonis Foundation begins settlement of the first extra-solar
colony, the planet Demeter. Later that year, other colonies are founded
on Eden Prime and Terra Nova.

Humanity meets a new aggressor in 2157 in the form of the Turians, who
attack them for activating a dormant mass relay. The Citadel Council, of
which the Turians are members but which the humans know nothing about,
has ruled such actions illegal. The conflict is relatively bloodless -
only a few hundred lives are lost on both sides. The Council quickly
negotiates a cease-fire once they learn about the situation.

In 2160, the Systems Alliance Parliament is created to give a voice to
the new colonies. Three years later, the United Nations Space Command
replaces Star Control as the premier military-scientific organization
responsible for protecting Earth. The UNSC will report to the Systems
Alliance, rather than the United Nations. Privately, it is widely
believed that structure and leadership of Star Control were to blame for
humanity's warlike response to the Turians, and that it is time for new
blood.

![mass\_effect\_3\_citadel\_station\_dremscene\_by\_droot1986-d4x6kux.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image7.jpg) {.ui .medium .left .floated .image}

In 2165, humanity is granted an embassy on the Citadel - a massive,
high-tech space station that acts as the hub of civilization in the
galactic region. Though mankind has a reputation for aggression and
fractiousness, the leading voices on the Citadel Council - the Asari,
the Salarians, and the Turians - recognize that Earth's history of
hostile alien contact is responsible for this attitude.

In 2176, a group of police assigned to escort a dangerous prisoner find
out that the inhabitants of a mining town on Mars have been killed or
have disappeared. The cause is a series of psychic emanations from the
Prothean cache, reacting to the imminent approach of the Reapers,
causing local humans to become "possessed", ritually scarify themselves,
and attack anyone not also possessed. ^[[Ghosts of Mars](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostsOfMars)]

![Newt\_and\_Ripley\_after\_Crash.png](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image36.png) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

In 2179, Warrant Officer Ellen Ripley of the Nostromo is recovered in
an escape pod, and briefed by the Weyland-Yutani corporation. The
colonization of planet LV-426 ran into a problem and the company wants
her assistance. UNSC marines are dispatched to investigate, with Ripley
acting as a special advisor. Together they discover an infestation of
Flood xenomorphs. The survivors destroy the colony, and the infestation,
using the colony's nuclear reactor by causing it to go critical. Only
Ripley, Corporal Dwayne Hicks, and a surviving colonist named Newt
survive the incident. ^[[Aliens](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienS)]

![Mass-effect-saren-geth.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image14.jpg) {.ui .medium .left .floated .image}

The most momentous events of this era begins in 2183 with the Eden
Prime War. The Geth, a synthetic race created by the Quarians, have
secretly allied with the Reaper Sovereign, in preparation for the
Reapers' repeated conquest and destruction of organic life in the
galaxy. One member of the Systems Alliance, Commander Shepard, is
instrumental in relaying information about the Reapers to the Citadel
Council. ^[[Mass Effect](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1)]

In 2185, Shepard is revived by a human-supremacist terrorist
organization called Cerberus. The Commander investigates disappearances
on human colonies, uncovering the actions of a race called the
Collectors. In reality, these are indoctrinated remnants of the
long-lost Protheans, created by the Reapers as
tools. ^[[Mass Effect 2](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2)]

![Crucible\_under\_construction.png](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image26.png) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

The Reaper action in the galaxy comes to a head in 2186, when they
invade the galaxy en masse. Shepard discovers the plans for the
long-lost Prothean super-weapon, the Crucible, and is responsible for
driving a galaxy-wide war effort to build up the resources needed to
construct and fire it.

As the Reapers approach and besiege Earth, Shepard activates the
Crucible. It fires, destroying the Reapers, but also crippling or
damaging the mass relay network throughout the
galaxy. ^[[Mass Effect 3](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3)]

Age of War (2199 - 2699)
-------------------------

With the mass relay network shut down, Earth is cut off from the rest
of the galaxy. Now free of mass-effect interference, space fold
technology works without complication.

In 2199, an alien race called the Gamilas begin unleashing radioactive
bombs, delivered via meteorite, across the Earth's surface. Humans
retreat into underground shelters for protection, but most have been
affected by the radioactivity and have limited lifespans. The Gamilas
follow up their bombardment with a powerful space fleet, which does
considerable damage to the war-ravaged Systems Alliance navy.

![Yamato-Ship.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image8.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

Earth receives a message from the planet Iscandar, in the direction of
the Large Magellanic Cloud. Their leader, Queen Starsha, offers
humanitarian aid, including a technology that will repair DNA damage
done by the Gamilas. Cut off from the surface by the radiation and
meteoric bombardment, human engineers build a new ship, the
Yamato, using the only materials they have easy access to -
the underwater wrecks of battleships and starships. They manage to equip
it with a reaction weapon called a "wave motion gun", similar to the
SDF's main gun, and a modified version of the space-fold engine.

The Yamato completes its one-year journey to Iscandar,
eventually defeating the Gamilas invasion forces and learning their
secret: their own planet is dying, and they had hoped to use Earth as a
new world. ^[[Space Battleship Yamato](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato)]

Expeditions to Epsilon Eridani uncover several alien races in the
region. In 2245, the commander of the Earth vessel
Prometheus initiates hostilities with one such advanced
race, the Minbari. The Minbari efficiently exterminate the human
military forces they encounter. To everyone's surprise, the Minbari
surrender immediately on the verge of conquering Earth, at the Battle of
the Line in 2247. The Minbari secretly identify the humans as members of
the "protoculture", from which they also descend, and find both a
biological and psychic affinity between the two races. Their religious
law forbids conflict with their own kin.

![b5lt.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image27.jpg) {.ui .medium .left .floated .image}

Between 2252 and 2262, a succession of five space stations are
established in Epsilon Eridani space by the Earth forces. Recognizing
the value the Citadel provided as a place for diplomacy and commerce,
mankind inaugurates their own version of the concept, the "Babylon"
station. Babylon 5 welcomes ambassadors from the rival Centauri and Narn
races, as well as many other aliens. ^[[Babylon 5](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive)]

![rn4lrg.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image39.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

In 2259, Earth is attacked by meteorites again, this time sent by a
race of genetically modified insects dubbed the "Bugs". The UNSC
speculates that the Bugs were created from the rachni and have been
observing the Earth-Gamilas conflict to learn about Terran weaknesses.
The armed forces mobilize to strike back against the Bugs, tracking them
to their home base on the planet
Klendathu. ^[[Starship Troopers](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarshipTroopers)]

By 2261, Earth - thanks to the attacks from the Bugs - has become
increasingly militarized and fascistic. The leadership limits voting and
many other civil rights to those who will serve in the armed forces,
institutes rationing, and cracks down on dissent. In response, several
human colonies, and Babylon 5 itself, secede from the Systems Alliance
and eventually invade Earth to liberate it from the despotic regime of
President Clark.

By 2291, advances in space-fold technology lead to the "slipspace"
drive. Similar to frequency-hopping radios used by the military, ships
could "slip" through fold waves, effectively disguising their point of
origin and bypassing many of the dangers of folding space.

More and more, strategic planners agreed that aliens knowing the
location of Earth was itself a risk. Increasingly stringent methods of
protecting Earth's location were instituted, culminating in the "Cole
protocol" of 2540 that meant a ship's captain would blow his ship up and
suicide rather than let aliens seize control of the ship's navigational
computers.

In 2321, the ORION program is green-lit. Compared to many alien races,
humans are physically lacking. Since many alien races have been found to
be genetically compatible, work gets underway to engineer a trans-human
soldier, using the best of mankind's genes and the most useful alien
genes available.

![halo-5-blue-team.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image34.jpg) {.ui .medium .right .floated .image}

In 2362, the planet Reach in the Epsilon Eridani system is colonized.
It becomes the new center for the UNSC's military and is fortified
against any conventional attack. The rationale is that if Earth falls,
humanity's military might shouldn't be compromised as well. Reach
becomes the home of the SPARTAN-II program, the successor of ORION,
using genetic material from human heroes such as Commander Shepard as
the template for a batch of super-soldiers.

Military technology has gradually learned from the ancient Zentradi
warriors' doctrine: simple, rugged, and predictable often beats
high-tech. Soldiers can't be mass-produced, but equipment can.
Slug-throwers and mass-driven weapons continue to be used despite an
understanding of high-energy and exotic physics.

In 2525, humanity is first attacked by a theocratic alliance of aliens
known as the Covenant. Led by a pact between the San 'Shyuum and
Sangheili, the Covenant worshipped the Forerunners and other ancient
aliens as gods, and the destruction of the mass relay network by
humanity is effectively heresy.

The next twenty-eight years sees a continual state of war between the
UNSC and the Covenant. In 2552, the Covenant come to Reach and
eventually prevail over the human military forces protecting
it. ^[[Halo Reach](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach)]

At the same time, a human ship called the Pillar of
Autumn comes across one Halo, now infected by the Flood and
under the control of the Covenant. They prevent the firing of the Halo
(an event which would wipe out much of the organic life in the galaxy,
as had happened once before). ^[[Halo](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved)]

The next six years is a whirlwind of warfare. The UNSC struggles to
protect humankind against the Covenant, while dealing with the
resurgence of the Flood, the activation of Forerunner artifacts, and an
eventual invasion of Earth. The Battle of Installation 00 marked the
effective end of the Covenant, as it was torn apart by internal schisms,
the assassination of key leaders, and the stresses of
war. ^[[Halo 3](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3)]

![wing-4.jpg](/assets/attack-from-the-stars/image28.jpg) {.ui .medium .left .floated .image}

In 2629, humans encounter a race of hostile feline aliens called the
Kilrathi. From then until 2671, sporadic fighting between the two
species keeps humanity on a war
footing. ^[[Wing Commander](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WingCommander)]

In 2633, alien allies of the Kilrathi, dubbed the "Red Falcon", manage
to land on Earth and set up a base. Engineered super-soldiers Bill Rizer
and Lance Bean are dispatched to deal with the infiltration, and manage
to destroy the base. ^[[Contra](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra)]

Age of Stewardship (2700 -)
----------------------------

Centuries of fighting off extraterrestrial invaders, of leading and
following, has matured humanity. In the decades following the war with
the Kilrathi, human starships spread throughout the stars. From Epsilon
Eridani to Council space, Earth's war vessels come with seasoned
warriors, simple but powerful weapons, and a message:

"We are not your leaders, nor your slaves. We are your Shepherds."

Humans have in effect become the new Zentradi, protecting the children
of the protoculture and their allies. Any race that needs assistance can
petition them for protection. Unlike the Zentradi, humanity also has its
own culture and emotional fulfillment. They will want for nothing.

There may always be war in the galaxy, but peace has never been closer.
