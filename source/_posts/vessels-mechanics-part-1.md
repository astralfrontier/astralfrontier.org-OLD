The "Vessels" game I've been working on has been a struggle.
Questions needed answering: what do emotions really do in a group
situation? What is the right way to model influencing those emotions?

I had a conversation with a friend on G+,
who's a subject matter expert on the brain.
This was thoroughly enlightening, and gave me a model to work from.

In the game, the basic cycle of manipulation is:

1. **Disrupt**. The community's emotional state will want to stay how it is, and effort is required to shatter it.
2. **Discover**. What happened in the wake of the disruptive act(s)? What is the community hiding? What new factors will come to light?
3. **Direct**. Having found points of leverage, the PCs must now act to take advantage of (or circumvent) the community's mood to arrange things in a new, more satisfactory, fashion.

PCs will have backstory elements that give them an advantage with
one or more stages this process.

What opposes the PCs at each stage?

The *disrupt* stage has two opposing forces: the risks the PCs are willing
to take through their actions, and the strength of the undesirable emotion.

The *discover* stage is the chance for the players to make truth declarations
about the situation, perhaps with a currency earned through successful
disruption, perhaps some other way. There should be a limited supply of
currency you can spend to make advantageous discoveries, and a possibility
of surprises.

The *direct* stage is when PCs try to shift conditions in their favor.
This can come from the discoveries made in the last stage, and/or from
the community's own requirements. For example, a story of forgiveness
may not be possible in a town whose inhabitants are thirsty for blood
and vengeance, and attempts to structure such a story should be resisted
or have a higher cost.

Players repeat the disrupt-discover-direct stages until they arrive at
a satisfactory conclusion. There should be a limited number of attempts
they have to get this right, to add an overall risk to the situation.
