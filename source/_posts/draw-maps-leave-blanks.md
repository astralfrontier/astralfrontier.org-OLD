This is more discussion about the Super-Sheriffs of Sagan City game,
found online [here](https://www.tavern-keeper.com/campaign/764/latest).

Today I want to talk about how I applied the principle of
"draw maps, leave blanks" to the superhero genre.

<!-- more -->

One of my players says this: "I was just thinking...
there could be times when this super mitochondria
appeared throughout the ages of human history,
which could explain ancient gods or heroes or mysterious beings, etc."

I was overjoyed. I proceeded to run down some of the posts
that [Villains Victorious](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/)
ran through last year, making the case for exactly this.
I'll do one better - I'll pull the list from TV Tropes' page on the
[Fantasy Kitchen Sink](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink):

* Fairies - discussed [here](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/2014/07/wavelength-posts-agartha.html). An "Arcadia" or "other world" can be a shared hallucination, modulating participants' super-abilities to affect the real world in return.
* Ghosts, Mummies, Zombies - discussed [here](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/2014/07/wavelength-posts-undead-edition.html). Zombies, skeletons, mummies, liches, and ghosts are all explicitly discussed.
* Vampires - has a representative [here](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/2014/06/supervillains-of-note-faduma.html).
* Werewolves - has a representative [here](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/2014/08/werewolves.html).
* Sea Monsters - discussed [here](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/2014/08/how-to-take-over-world-ocean-style.html) as a world conquest tactic.
* Giant Worms - encountered on Gaia, [here](https://www.tavern-keeper.com/roleplay/1053).
* Superhuman Mutants - a core part of the setting.
* Aliens - discussed [here](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/2014/06/beyond-between-before-alternative.html). The PCs of the game have actually encountered one alien race, who are just as much colonists on Gaia as the humans.
* Time Travellers - this is the only one I missed, due to how scary it is. However, it's possible for teleporters to travel in time as well as space.
* Espers - another core part of the setting, for some value of "esper".
* Angels - has a representative [here](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/2014/07/superheroes-of-note-illumina.html).
* Demons - no characters self-identify as demons, though [Father Freak](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/2014/07/monsters-of-note-father-freak.html) is sometimes referred to as one.
* God, Jerkass Gods, Evil Gods, Lazy Gods - no provable gods have made an appearance, though the groundwork for how they would function is given [here](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-question-of-magic.html), and it's suggested the Egyptian pantheon were supers [here](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/2014/08/dragons-dinosaurs-and-giant-monsters.html).
* Eldritch Abominations
* Precursors - a possibility for aliens as discussed [here](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/2014/06/beyond-between-before-alternative.html).
* Magic - discussed [here](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/2014/09/the-question-of-magic.html), but not conclusively demonstrated.
* Psi - no special psychic forces exist, though gravity manipulation and other powers cover many psychic powers. Telepathy in particular is discussed [here](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/2014/09/telepathy-and-supervillain.html).
* Chi - discussed [here](http://villainsvictorious.blogspot.com/2014/08/chi-powers-and-super-martial-artist.html). Mr. Big concludes that "chi" as a unique force doesn't exist, but many powers attributed to chi are still possible for supers to accomplish.

What do many of these things have in common?
That *the setting hasn't committed to them*.
They're possible, but nothing in the game hinges on magic, religion,
aliens, or time travel being real.

The "map" of our setting, then, is what's *possible*.
And the "blanks" on the map - the spots that players can fill in
as they wish - are what's *real*.
If nobody's particularly interested in exploring religion, for example,
then Illumina and Father Freak can remain "just supers" or mysteries.
If someone wants to write an alternate history where the Illuminati
is a thing and has been conserving the blood of Christ,
the unified power origin is ready for that.
If someone wants to play a super-vampire, I can do that today.

Why is this important to me in a superhero game?
Because what you leave in, or leave out, helps define the tone of the game.
Sagan City has a sci-fi feel right now, with some personal mystical journey
stuff mixed in, so I've plugged in aliens and space travel,
but no magic, no religion, and no psychic powers or
shared-hallucination fairies (yet).
A different game, with a different tone,
would plug in different Fantasy Kitchen Sink elements.
