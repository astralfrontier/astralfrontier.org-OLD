**Day 2: What do you look for in an RPG?**

RPGs are typically segmented into "setting" and "mechanics". Modern gamer thinking seems to follow a few trends: mechanics should be subordinate to setting; fewer mechanics are better, but not too few; highly specific settings are okay.

There's two other elements that interest me: how well the mechanics accommodate both beginner and veteran players, and how appealing the voice of the setting sounds to me.

**Mechanical accommodation**: I like system mastery, but I don't want to jump into a game that requires me to start with it. My ideal system teaches me how to play it as I play, but then steps out of my way and lets me rebuild new stuff from the ingredients it gave me. This is why I really dislike PBTA games based around playbooks, for example. Early on, a playbook is good because it gets me going immediately, says something about the setting, and introduces key mechanical concepts. But what about later? What if I don't want to play the Gunlugger, or the Barbarian, or the Janus, or the Vampire? What if I have my own ideas? Some games make it easy to remix and synthesize a new character, but others don't.

**The voice of the setting**: there's cyberpunk, Tolkienesque, future-space, urban fantasy, etc. etc. games that have really appealed to me, and plenty more that didn't. I'm less interested in the specific genre, and much more in what the individual setting says about that genre, and lets me say as well. Much has been written about Cyberpunk 2077 and its predecessor tabletop RPG, and how "style as substance" and other elements elevated the game's atmosphere, and I agree with all of that. I want more of that - a setting that's not just a bunch of places and people, but a few inspirational places and people with a clear through line that points me in the direction of creating more.
