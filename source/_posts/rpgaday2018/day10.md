**Day 10: How has gaming changed you?**

I grew up in a Christian household, where even watching television on the Sabbath (Saturday, we were Seventh-Day Adventists) was forbidden. My dad was politically liberal, and my mom was not. The constant element was religion, and the reminder that movies like "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" were witchcraft and to be avoided, while turning water to wine or walking on water was perfectly okay.

I discovered gaming at an early age, though I had nobody to play with for long periods of time. I played Battletech with friends in 5th grade, participated a bit in the frustratingly low-tech but fascinating online roleplaying communities during the BBS days, and eventually learned about MUDs, MOOs, and MUSHes in college. I met people I'd never have met otherwise through these environments, and was exposed to all-new, all-different ideas.

Throughout this, and through my adult life, gaming gave me a vehicle for exploring new notions in a safe context. Human beings respond in similar ways to real and simulated events, and we feel in ourselves the pain or pleasure we see other people experience. Because of that, I feel that gaming experiences have helped me understand ideas like violence or tyranny without needing to undergo (or inflict) them myself. I wouldn't compare myself to people who have suffered at the hands of such things - instead, the value of gaming is that I've been made much more receptive to those peoples' needs and wants. Other social ideas, like representation and bigotry, could be explored through gaming without hurting real people.

Without these experiences, maybe I would have gone to a private, Christian college. I would have studied computer science, of course. But I don't think I would have whatever empathy and kindness I have now, and I certainly wouldn't have been able to help the people I have (who I've met through gaming or similar activities), so there's that.
