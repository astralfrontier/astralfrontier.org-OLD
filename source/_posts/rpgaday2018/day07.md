Still catching up on #RPGaDAY2018

**Day 7: How can a GM make the stakes important?**

Some definitions, because I think we sometimes lose the plot when talking about this. I define "stakes" (for this purpose) as "story consequences in which the players have an emotional investment".

Stakes are stakes because they aren't resolved yet, and they can be both won and lost. If it's a foregone conclusion that something's going to fall a certain way, it's not something at stake. But how something turns out can be a stake as well. Maybe the Princess is fated to marry a handsome man, but is it the plucky but determined peasant, or the wicked Baron?

The best stakes are usually personal - something the PCs are actually tied to, not just abstracts like Duty or Honor. One's life, possessions, family, friends, or loves are personal stakes. Good stakes can be tied to larger conflicts, and that's a good way to scale the seriousness of a stake.

In any scene, the GM should think about the stakes in play. How many players are interested in them? How many PCs? You'll know by watching what the players do, and listening to what they say. If the GM is the only one who cares about a given issue, maybe it's not engaging, and they should drop it.

Stakes are important when they can be lost. Make sure player choices have an effect on the stakes, for good or bad. Put them at risk - and it's always better if they're at risk in a way that traces logically back to a PC's action. But it's just as important to pay off someone's actions by settling a stake in their favor.
