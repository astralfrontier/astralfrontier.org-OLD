Catching up on #RPGaDAY2018 after two days of moving!

**Day 5: Favorite recurring NPC?**

I have a favorite type of recurring NPC, rather than a specific one (though I'll cite a couple examples). I don't have a catchy name for this concept, but if you need one, call it the Chaser - not as in someone who pursues, but as a palate cleanser. The purpose of this NPC is to even out the tone of the game. If things get too serious, a comedy NPC can make an appearance. Conversely, if things are light-hearted and goofy, a serious NPC can also show up.

Done badly, the Chaser can disrupt the feel of the game. But done well, they can give players the signal that things aren't hurtling too far in one direction or another, or say something new about what else is going on in the game by contrasting their actions against everything else.

An example Chaser of mine: in a Guardians of the Galaxy-type scifi game, I had three characters - a military commander, his beleaguered subordinate, and the bloodythirsty but dim sergeant ("voted most likely to be fragged"). In a game with planet-destroying superweapons and violent xenomorph swarms, these three would show up and shift things to comedy for a bit.

An example Chaser elsewhere: the FFXIV MMO's main storyline can be fairly serious at times: war, racism, heroic sacrifices, invasion and occupation and quislings, amnesia and guilt, and more. But then Hildibrand Manderville shows up, and you know things are gonna be okay for awhile. Most interestingly, the Hildibrand quests can sometimes tie into what's going on in the main quests (though not vice versa, as these are optional), putting things in a new light, or explaining mysteries. And they are often touching and heartwarming, as the good inspector helps young lovers or children in need.

Darth Vader is a main villain in Star Wars, but he's kind of a Chaser in this same sense. Han Solo gets up to antics, Luke is serious but young, there's stormtroopers but nobody gets seriously hurt, and it's all neat high adventure, but then Vader shows up, and every time he does someone dies or loses a hand or something.

I think the key to using a Chaser properly is to know when to fit them in. Don't break the flow of your game, but do use a Chaser to change the direction of things for a bit, or fit them into gaps in an existing story as a breather.
