**Day 26: Your gaming ambition for the next year**

The stretch goal is easy: publish at least two playable, replayable, and entertaining games. I'd take one as a partial success here.

As a player and GM, I'd like to maintain at least one steady game through next year. My gaming schedule has been pretty bad for a lot of reasons, and it's been hard to keep a group together due to changing life circumstances. This sounds like a pretty miserable goal, but that's where I am. :)

As a person, I'd like to do the same thing I tried to do last year: use gaming to talk about meaningful topics in safe and productive ways, and to help my friends through difficult times or give them a breather from stressful lives.
