**Day 13: Describe how your play has evolved**

I've definitely come a long way. Part of my gaming style has always come from who I am, or lessons I've learned, and other parts of it are the group I'm with, and the rules they prefer to use. Even today, my gaming style is very different if I'm with trusted friends who are just goofing off, vs. with serious-minded gamers who want to tell stories. These experiences came in four broad phases.

During phase one, I was in school. I had no idea what I was doing, and was gaming with people who did (but didn't take any of it seriously in the slightest), so Rolemaster characters like "Brian the Insane Ranger" were the result.

For phase two, I gamed with a mixed group of people (in which I was literally the only straight man of the group, a beneficial education in and of itself): some of them had literary aspirations, some just wanted to have fun, some wanted to inject their own religious or mystical beliefs into the game, and some wanted to be serious badasses. The group played almost nothing but White Wolf games at the intersection of these priorities, with occasional diversions into Star Wars (where I played a highly enjoyable mercenary arachnid alien sidekick). Sometimes we went along with it at full speed, other times we had an almost adversarial GM-and-players relationship. But it was all worth it.

The third phase was mostly online, with text-driven games (this was before broadband voice chat) and a tight group of players, all trying different systems and genres. We wrote endless prose, spun out side stories, and generally treated the whole activity more like a collaborative hypertext novel with occasional randomness than a series of D&D-style gamist activities. It was intimate and emotional and inspiring.

I'm in phase four, where I usually pretend to be very mature and serious about my gaming, but secretly enjoy those throwbacks to earlier times. At one time, I might have been ashamed of things like "Brian the Insane Ranger", but now I've got the confidence to say "yeah, that was an earlier me, I own that". I can do characters that have interesting and emotional story arcs, tie neatly into other PCs' or NPCs' stories, and spark deep conversations about topics like humanity or civil rights, and then turn around and play Karl the yokel sidekick to someone else's plucky adventurer type.

I don't know what phase five will look like, nor how I'll get there. We'll see. :)
