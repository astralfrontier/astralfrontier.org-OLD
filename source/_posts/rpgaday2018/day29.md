**Day 29: Share a friendship you have because of RPGs**

I think all of my long-lasting friendships have come from some kind of online "game" (including the text-based MUDs of old), but I'll go with local and recent and say **Gray Pawn**, who I got to first meet at the Wayward Coffeehouse for some pulp space opera shenanigans. He's the guy that gave me the confidence to try actual game design, not just create worlds, and it's been a fun and rewarding experience. On top of that, he's got an amazing ability to infuse both characters and games with heart and purpose, even when he doesn't quite believe in his ability to do it.
