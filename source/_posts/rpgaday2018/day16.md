**Day 16: Describe your plans for your next game**

Next game I'm designing: this is "flip-a-card", which desperately needs a catchier name. Right now the mechanics are settling in (not that there's many), and I'm realizing that I need three things:

1. A really kickass setting that can be expressed through a set of index cards
2. Some kind of Mail Merge deal where I can type up a bunch of text and print 3x5" or 4x6" cards out from that
3. Time with people to playtest this creation

We were through one session and reality intervened, so we sort of made playtest progress, but I think there's a lot more to be done.

<!-- more -->

Next game I'm running: I have two, one of which has already started. This is a basic D&D 5th edition "clear the hex" dungeon crawl as requested by friends, so I'm using it as an opportunity to learn about D&D encounter building and non-combat challenges. So far so good.

The game that hasn't started is GURPS 4th edition, in the spirit of Tale Spin and similar inter-war cliffhanger pulp action stuff, but with what I hope is an emotional center worth playing through. The premise is that a gigantic meteor was discovered a few years ago in the Atlantic Ocean, that it emanates a strange energy called "aether", and that the Great Powers are gathering in the island chains nearby to harness this power.

You'd think this means a lot of backstabbin' and cut-throat double-dealin', right? Well, one quality of aether is that it creates a low-level emotional gestalt, or hive mind effect, among those who are exposed to it. The longer you spend around the meteor, the more empathic you become - but only to other aether-touched people. So those who have been sent to fight for the meteor are gradually becoming their own sort of clan or family. Of course this serves as a way to enforce thou-shalt-not-kill, live-to-fight-another-day, recurring-villains type pulp genre conventions, but I think it's cool enough as its own thing to play around with.
