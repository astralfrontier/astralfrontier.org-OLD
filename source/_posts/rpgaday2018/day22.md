**Day 22: Which non-dice system appeals to you?**

I enjoy light-touch systems that encourage social scenes between characters. There's a lot of fun in games where the PCs just talk about whatever, sure. But sometimes you need to set a certain mood or hold a certain tone. Human interaction is at the heart of a lot of storytelling, and to set that mood you need certain types of interaction to happen.

Examples are certain PBTA-style Bonds (earn XP if you explore a topic with another PC), Influence and many moves from Masks, and games with "downtime scenes" or the like.
