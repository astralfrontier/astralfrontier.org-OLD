I usually don't do these. I'll give it a try this time.

**Day 1: What do you love about RPGs?**

I could give a lot of reasons that sound very generic but I'll cut out all the bullshit and get right to it. It feels like there's a faucet of creative outlet in my head and if it doesn't bleed off once in awhile, I'll become very agitated or sad. So I need outlets for that, and RPGs are the most suitable means. Why?

I mean, I've tried writing stories. The problem is that stories are built around conflict and change, and when it's beloved characters I want to see succeed, the inside of my head sounds like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QswFm2rvSY8).

I've very recently gotten better about this, but in the past I struggled to put any challenges in front of characters when I was the only person in the picture. An RPG brings in other people, none of whom have that same motive to preserve the happiness and status quo for my lovely snowflakes. Challenge, and hence drama, and hence value as a story, all arise from that.

Aside from that, I just really enjoy problem-solving challenges, emotional and social engagements _in ways where I feel comfortable_ (that's key), and RPGs provide plenty of that too.
