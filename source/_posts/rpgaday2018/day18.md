**Day 18: What art inspires your game?**

It's probably no surprise that the anime and manga art style, as well as many of its genre conventions, feed into the games I prefer to run or play in. This even extends to Western genre stalwarts like the D&D dungeon crawl, where stuff like "Record of Lodoss War" and later fantasy series like "Fairy Tail" shake up what we think of as elves or wizards.

I don't typically follow specific artists, but Charles Vess and Wayne Barlow are exceptions. They've carved out some amazing spaces in fantasy and scifi, respectively, that I continue to enjoy exploring.

The art of the Final Fantasy series, by people such as Yoshitaka Amano and Tetsuya Nomura, has really done it for me as well. FF protagonists can wield great magical or mysterious power, but they can also be vulnerable, confused, needy, loving, and otherwise recognizably human. They travel in realms with familiar elements (and series staples like chocobos and airships), but with strange and awe-inspiring exceptions (like the crystal shards that dominate the landscapes in FFXIV, and the floating islands of Heavensward). The art choices for those characters and their world depict something that's at once familiar and foreign, which is to me the essence of a good fantasy RPG.
