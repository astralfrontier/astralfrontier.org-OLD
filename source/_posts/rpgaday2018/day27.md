**Day 27: Share a great stream/actual play**

Well, you knew this was coming.

The GM of the Monday Masks game, [Doyce Testerman](http://randomaverage.com/), has put a lot of work into reformatting the game as a [podcast](http://randomaverage.com/index.php/category/podcast/feed/), in addition to the [original YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfpTPTXP0TzPI8DaN1AktpqJZ7Uo-igjr) of the sessions. While the YouTube videos come with maps, goofy memes, and other visual accompaniment, the podcast is cleaned up, sped up, and diced into neat segments under an hour each.

If you want to jump into the issues list and pick a specific one to listen to based on what happens, here's an index to everything: http://wiki.menagerie.team/Category:Issues (click on a specific issue to find a brief recap of major events, or ask me to put together a master page that does it)
