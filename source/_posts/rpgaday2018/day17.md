**Day 17: Describe the best compliment you've had while gaming**

Best compliment received in-game: in Turning Tides (set in the World of Warcraft universe), my undead wizard Ezra rubbed elbows with the influential and powerful. Members of the shamanic Earthen Ring and the druidic Cenarion Circle, for example. On two occasions, he pitched a really outlandish plan, and got told to his face, "are you mad?" Which was amazing because being Crazy Awesome was Ezra's schtick, and the plans were mad and they still worked.

Best compliment received out of game: I think probably "I like this game you've designed" and/or "I want to run, hack on, or otherwise make use of this game", is the best thing I can hear. And I've heard it a few times.

Best compliment given: I'm not a big fan of effusive praise, but I like showing effort and taking action to reward other players or games that I like. In the Monday Masks game, we collectively threw together a wiki for the world, created art for the characters, wrote code for a Roll20 forum search engine, spun out a ton of side stories and fiction, brought cool NPCs to life, and just generally showed how much we loved the game by giving back to it. The GM definitely noticed and appreciates it too. :)
