**Day 12: Wildest Character Concept**

Experiment 36 was the name of an automaton created by a university on a world where magic was real and spirits existed. 36 was constructed from a mystical water used by far-off tribes to commune with the spirit world, and brought back to the university. It was placed into a boiler and used as the power source and motivator for a robotic frame. Thus, 36 was basically a spirit animating a steampunk body.

36 was a soft-spoken mechanical Hagrid in terms of its relationship with the students: not someone who was an actual teacher, and an outsider in important ways, but certainly a mentor figure, assistant, or companion. It maintained an herb garden, studied theology, created illuminated manuscripts, and otherwise spent its days in monk-like contemplation and study.
