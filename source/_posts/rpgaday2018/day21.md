**Day 21: Which dice mechanic appeals to you?**

Following from inspiring mechanics yesterday, I think that any dice system that isn't a total... well, roll of the dice, appeals to me. Typical d20 systems are frustrating to me for this reason, although D&D 5E's advantage and disadvantage mechanic (along with related stuff like the Luck feat) and the general scaling-down of DCs has been helpful.

I've done some game design around the d4-6-8-10-12 polyhedron pyramid, such as [Inept Sorcerers](http://peppermile.com/inept-sorcerers.html) and it's been fun to run and to play. I think there's more opportunity to mess with different dice sizes, rather than just large piles of identical dice or a fixed die/dice pool.

Systems that assign dice as stats or skills seem promising, but I've had other problems with enough of them that I can't cite an example I've really enjoyed playing (Savage Worlds is an example of a system I was actively unhappy with). I'm happy to give such systems a try, or revisit a system I had a bad experience with to try again, if someone wants to pitch me on it.

All that said, I do enjoy throwing fistfuls of dice from time to time, particularly in games where an over-the-top outcome is tied to it (Exalted, Champions).
