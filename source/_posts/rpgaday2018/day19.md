**Day 19: What music enhances your game?**

I don't typically use background music at the table. It's hard for me to come up with what I think is an appropriate soundtrack, because I keep expecting the music to follow the tone of events, and that would require an actual DJ or something on hand (or a bunch of playlist micromanagement). There's plenty of music that I listen to while prepping game material, though. A lot of it is on YouTube, in the form of mixes or playlists.

<!-- more -->

* [Ambient Epicuros](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheAmbientepicuros) has a ton of trance, chillout, and other mixes that convey moods. Planet Mecha, the Artificial Intelligence series, and Metropolis are all evocative.
* [Cryo Chamber](https://www.youtube.com/user/cryochamberlabel) is a dark ambient music label with stuff influenced by HP Lovecraft and dark fantasy. The "tribal ambient and fallen orc empires" mix is wonderful.
* [VA-11 HALL-A the Second Round](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8w_Q57RQJc) is a great upbeat cyberpunk soundtrack

I've created some playlists for characters and events, even if they weren't played in-game, just to get into the spirit of the matter:

* [Vyortovia Mix](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN1VwusMjomSqFSQvl1E2ec_QhAI0jZnl) is my playlist for a particularly climactic event in the Monday Masks game, where our PCs literally fought off an invading army. The playlist is in-character, assembled by the team's 80s-loving hard-rocking car robot Otto.
* [LEO MIX #1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN1VwusMjomQ8gENlC4TVISFdxnR64EVT) was my attempt to put together a soundtrack for Link, as he was at the start of that game.
