**Day 20: Which game mechanic inspires your play the most?**

I know plenty of people who have jumped on the PBTA bandwagon, and sometimes it's the superficial stuff they glom onto, rather than the deep core of what makes PBTA work. Playbooks! GM doesn't roll! Failure! Many of these same people feel let down by Fate, with comments like "you can just buy success so easily". But PBTA will not magically help you GM if you don't actively invest in using the tools it gives you, or worse, run it as though it's an OSR game or something.

There's a related vein of thought that says "play to find out", as though random rolls are intrinsically better than a character being good at something because, y'know, their concept is that they are good at it. "Roll 2d6 and add +1" is a general class of mechanics that actively discourages my play. If you hand me a playbook with a list of someone else's notion of what this iconic ideal needs to be like, then tell me I'm going to be useless at doing any of it a flat percentage of the time, I'm going to drift through this game without any emotional investment. I'm fine with "this character didn't achieve their goal in the moment". What I'm pushing back against is "this character is diminished or disregarded because dice".

I'd like people to briefly read this post on reddit: ["Fail Forward: How Han Solo failed almost every roll except the impossibly difficult ones"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/3ysh48/fail_forward_how_han_solo_failed_almost_every/).

This captures pretty much what I want: a string of failures and success that don't reflect the vagarities of the dice, but which help illustrate and build audience interest in the character. I don't want to fail because I rolled a 6, any more than I enjoy hearing OD&D graybeard stories where the climax is "and then I rolled a 20!" I want to fail because failing does something cool with the scene or the character, and I want to succeed for similar reasons.

Flip-a-card is an early attempt to make this happen. The basic idea is that you have 3+ cards which define your character in certain ways. You can flip one over to automatically succeed at any task the card relates to (e.g. I'm a barbarian, so I'm going to flip Barbarian over when I need to rage against something). But to flip that card back requires satisfying one of the writing prompts on the back - things that get your character in trouble, or advance the story in ways that make sense for that card, or whatever. The Dungeon World "eschew a convention of the civilized world" move might be an example that appears on Barbarian. So I can keep being a good Barbarian as long as I also keep being a dramatic Barbarian.

So basically, give me a mechanic where I get to say "my PC would succeed at this because it feels right", combined with "when my PC doesn't get what they are attempting to do, give me a reason that makes sense for that PC and pushes story forward".
