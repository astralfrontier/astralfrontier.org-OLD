**Day 8: How can we get more people playing?**

The way we get more people playing is to stop shutting the door in anyone's face.

I realize this answer might offend a certain breed of gamer. Good.

Many people have spoken, far more eloquently than I, about diversity and inclusiveness in gaming, and why it's so vital. Some people have spoken against it (often with the immortal non-disclaimer, "I'm not racist, but..."). So here's a simple reality:

If you make people feel unwelcome in a hobby, they will leave.

<!-- more -->

So how do you make people feel unwelcome? One way is to say things like "characters who look like you aren't welcome", in a variety of ways. You can say it explicitly ("Battlefield 5 is historically inaccurate for acknowledging female fighters") or implicitly (by omitting non-cis-straight-white-whatever characters from your fiction). In the latter case, maybe you don't know how to include such characters, or don't feel comfortable doing so. All I ask is that you do what you can, and if you criticize someone else for their omissions, take the time to make it constructive.

Personal identity aside, you also shut the door in peoples' faces by telling them how to have fun, or telling them they can't have fun doing the thing that's fun for them. Rules wars (D&D 3rd vs. 4th vs. 5th?) or attacking people for liking certain settings, mechanics, or genres is a sure way to drive people away. It's okay to say "I don't like something", but please avoid saying any variety of "you aren't allowed to like something".
