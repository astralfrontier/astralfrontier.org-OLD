Day 25: Name a game that had an impact on you in the last year.

If you've been following my posts, you can probably figure out the answer is "Masks", which coincidentally I've been playing for just over a year.

I've had a lot of other stuff happen: deaths in the family, house moves, major changes at work, friends getting busy or being unable to meet to game. I tried running a couple games that didn't pan out for various reasons, and that's been rough. But that Monday/Tuesday Masks game has been hitting like a prizefighter (almost) every week, and that's been good for me in a lot of ways.
