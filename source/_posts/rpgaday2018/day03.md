**Day 3: What gives a game staying power?**

Two key concepts in software engineering are reusability (I wrote this thing, can I avoid writing it again?) and composition (I wrote this thing, can I plug it into other things to make a bigger thing?). Software _as a system_ doesn't feel that different from game design, and I find similar principles applying to games. So what gives a game staying power is to what extent its elements can be reused elsewhere, or plugged into other stuff.

A positive example is GURPS. The 3rd and 4th edition GURPS worldbooks still sit on my shelf, and I still reference them, because a ton of the stuff they contain is relevant to other gaming interests. Lists of cybernetic or bio-tech augmentations, World War II weapons, summonable monsters.. the list goes on and on. The stats can be easily translated into other systems because they're based on real-world metrics (ranges in yards, for example). Whether I ever play a game of GURPS again is moot (although I might, we'll see what happens Saturdays once things calm down), the game is still worth space on my shelf.

A negative example is Dungeon World. I've thought about this for awhile, and I really dug DW for a time, but I realized that the reasons for doing so just echoed the reasons I enjoyed D&D 3rd, then 4th, then 5th edition - because I was contrasting them with the broken shit from the previous editions. DW looks good in comparison to D&D. But I'm not going to find new ways to play DW for the rest of my life, nor pull elements from DW out into other games. I find some of the principles of PBTA-based games, and DW in particular, innovative and clever, and I have enjoyed some DW games I've played, but as a replayable game, the only fun I've ever had with it was bringing stuff to DW that DW doesn't already do. That's a strike against it for purposes of this question.
