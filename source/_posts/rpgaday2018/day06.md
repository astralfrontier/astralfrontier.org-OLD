Still catching up on #RPGaDAY2018

**Day 6: How can players make a world seem real?**

These days, I'm actually down on the story elements of a character we call "backstory". If I'm in a game, I'm less interested in hearing about your past adventures, and more interested in participating in your future ones. For that reason, I want players to have whatever is the opposite of that. Call it "frontstory"?

Frontstory _is where the players want their PCs to go._

Okay, everyone who just jumped up and shouted some variant of "play to find out!" or "let it emerge organically from play!", sit down and hear me out.

Frontstory isn't a destined destination, it's a trajectory. Good frontstory says "here's what my PC is after". It doesn't say "here is where my PC will end up". But frontstory says something about the world, because whatever a PC wants is part of that world, what they'll be opposed by is part of the world, and so forth. A PC who wants revenge on an NPC, or wants to romance (or seduce) an NPC, or who wants to steal, win, or otherwise obtain something has just given you a string of encounters and challenges.

Good frontstory also gives places for other PCs to plug in. Do they want similar things? Are there conflicts between PCs about these things? Does one PC's frontstory intersect with another's? Will a PC without their own motives find a cause to uphold in someone else's dreams?

Frontstory can be vague. Some people will come to the table with a story ready to go: "I want to confront the Baron about my father's disappearance, aided by my mother's mystic ring". Other people are just here to fight orcs and don't have the time or creative energy to gin up a lot of detail. This is fine - "I want to fight orcs" can be unpacked over time. Maybe you ask the player for one new detail about fighting orcs every session - why they're doing it, who's with them, what the orcs think about this, or whatever.

At the end of the day, characters and game worlds feel real if we can recognize something about ourselves in them. "I feel unfulfilled, and need to do a thing" is pretty recognizable.
