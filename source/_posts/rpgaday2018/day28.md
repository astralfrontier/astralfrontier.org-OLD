**Day 28: Share whose inspiring gaming excellence you're grateful for**

Not Masks this time! Though that has been great.

Credit here goes to people like Gray Pawn, Jay Loomis, Mike Agney, Phil Nadeau, and the other gamers over the years who've run or played in some of the best games of my life.

Stuff like Pandora's Lair, Thursday play-test at the Treehouse, and other experiences won't make sense to most people without a lot of explanation, but I think part of the appeal of gaming is that sort of secret mystery - the unique alchemy that results when a few people do something fun together. Maybe those individual moments of magic are experienced and then lost, but we're always able to create new magic.
