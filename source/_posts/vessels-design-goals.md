What do I want out of this game? While this isn't an AW/DW game, that design vocabulary is useful and I am using it here.

* The game should be built around emotional resolutions for a series of specific crises.
* Rules should tell you what's on your character sheet, or how moves work. All other rules should be moves.
* Whenever possible, character sheets and moves should be self-documenting.

<!-- more -->

Stakes:

* Something must be at stake for both players and PCs.
* Removal from play must be a viable stake for player characters.
* There is no failure, only disappointment.
* There is no success, only hopes fulfilled.
* The MC starts the story, the players end it.

PCs:

* Characters must be differentiated in both function and style.
* Characters need not be equally powerful, only equally compelling.
* Most mechanics should confer both advantage and drawback.

Moves:

* Moves are about feelings and secrets, not physical actions.
* Revelation of identity and assumption of power should be a key mechanic.﻿
* There are no playbooks, only allegiances.
* Moves should illuminate a typical PC's motives and/or the world they live in.
* The system should welcome moves authored at the table.

More specifics coming soon.
