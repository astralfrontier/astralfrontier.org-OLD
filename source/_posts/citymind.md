Two ideas came together for me this morning:
a discussion of the mass graves of London,
and the recent victory of AlphaGo over Lee Sedol.

No, really.

I saw this post on Tumblr: [London And Its Dead].
It included passages like this:

> The Tube thus had to swerve to the side along a subterranean detour

> tangled in the soil—an artificial geology made of people,
> caught in the throat of greater London.

Then there's Wired's discussion of the [AlphaGo vs. Lee Sedol] game of Go.

I want you to imagine that this trend continues, and Google's DeepMind
technology is given control of another system with specific rules:
the management of city infrastructure.
Variables like budget, the conditions of roads and bridges,
population levels, geographical constraints, and so forth.

I wrote about this in Song of Eden, postulating an automated "living city"
called [Hubris]. In that case, the city had robots to realize its vision.
But here we'll scale back that ambition, and go with something similar.
We'll let a CityMind - a massive AI enabled by this sort of technology -
essentially act as a player in a game of "SimCity".
It will make decisions about resource allocation.
It will guide new construction, with input from the populace.
It won't be some sort of multi-tentacled octopus that directly runs
_everything_ - that would represent a significant strategic weakness.
But its high level decisions would be fed into other systems
and other processes.

Now we return to the dead of London.
During the AlphaGo matches, commentators said that the AI seemed to have
a "personality" or "style of play" at times.
How would the London CityMind react to the presence of things like mass graves?
How would its calculations include this city's history, which spans millennia?
Could the spirits of the departed metaphorically seep upwards into its calculations?
And if that happened, what would it look like?
Would its decisions start to seem as quirky and mysterious as the city itself?
