I posted this Minecraft filk a long time ago. It's random and goofy, so now seems a good time to put it up on this site.

_Sung to the tune of "In the Navy", by the Village People._

Where can you find pleasure, search the world for treasure,  
Get the goods for alchemy?  
Where can you obtain the magic building blocks that  
Burn for all eternity?

Where can you get glowstone, build a fortress of your own,  
Seeking stuff with bated breath?  
Sign up for the mining or listen to the whining  
When you lose your loot on death.

In the Nether, you can move eight times as fast.  
In the Nether, you'll be blown up by a ghast.  
In the Nether, come on now people, make a stand.  
In the Nether, you will surely need a hand.  
In the Nether, you can gather netherrack.  
In the Nether, you can take a portal back.  
In the Nether, don't forget to fill your sack.  
In the Nether, in the Nether.

They want you! They want you! They want you for the barbecue!  
If you like adventure don't you wait to enter  
The magic portal fast  
Get your diamond pick, find the black rock quick  
Then flint & tinder last

Maybe you are too weak to join up today  
But don't you worry 'bout a thing  
For I'm sure there will always be the good Nether  
Set above the lava sea.

In the Nether...

They want you! They want you! They want you for the barbecue!  
They want you! They want you! They want you for the barbecue!  
But..but..but I'm afraid of lava!  
Hey..hey..look, men...  
I get killed by weaksauce zombies!  
They want you! - Oh my goodness!  
They want you! - What am I gonna do in a cavern?  
They want you! They want you!  
In the Nether.  
In the Nether.
