With news that the Warcraft movie [will be released on December 18, 2015](https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/385161242886696960), we thought you should know how familiar it'll feel to players of the MMO.

1. Twenty-five idiots will pile into every theater, then whine at the end that they didn't get what they wanted.
2. Blizzard's characters do everything, and no player characters are involved.
3. The trailer will be far more epic than the experience itself.
4. Content will be available immediately via BitTorrent.
5. Initial movie will spin off into 60-minute daily TV episodes, which are just random rearrangements of familiar elements.
6. There's no sequel, just a series of deleted scenes and extended editions.
7. No matter what happens, the Alliance and the Horde will just keep fighting!
8. The movie will be balanced for viewer-vs.-viewer Internet forum arguments, rather than people who just go to enjoy the movie itself.
9. Special guest star: Chuck Norris.
10. There will be a shitty tie-in video game.
