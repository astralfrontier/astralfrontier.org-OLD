Now that FFXIV's Stormblood expansion has been with us for a few months,
I wanted to gather up everything I know about crafting in the new world
and share it in a single coherent place.

### Getting to 70

You should have all your Disciple of Hand classes at 70.
If you do not, follow the 1-70 guides available
at [FFXIV Guild](http://www.ffxivguild.com/).

If you are already 60 and want to push through the new Stormblood levels, start here:
[Alchemist](http://www.ffxivguild.com/ffxiv-alc-alchemist-leveling-guide-ffxivarr/5/) --
[Armorsmith](http://www.ffxivguild.com/ffxiv-ARM-Armorsmith-leveling-guide-ffxivarr/5) --
[Blacksmith](http://www.ffxivguild.com/ffxiv-BSM-Blacksmith-leveling-guide-ffxivarr/5/) --
[Carpentry](http://www.ffxivguild.com/ffxiv-crp-carpenter-leveling-guide-ffxivarr/5/) --
[Culinarian](http://www.ffxivguild.com/ffxiv-CUL-Culinarian-leveling-guide-ffxivarr/5/) --
[Goldsmith](http://www.ffxivguild.com/ffxiv-GSM-Goldsmith-leveling-guide-ffxivarr/5/) --
[Leatherworker](http://www.ffxivguild.com/ffxiv-ltw-leatherworker-leveling-guide-ffxivarr/5) --
[Weaver](http://www.ffxivguild.com/ffxiv-wvr-weaver-leveling-guide-ffxivarr/5/)

At minimum, you'll need almost all of them to 50,
so you have access to the required cross-class skills.
Your high-level products will also require precursor recipes
from ALC, GSM, LTW, WVR, and sometimes others.
BSM, LTW, and WVR are the key classes if you want to craft your own gear as you go.

I strongly encourage you to keep your Mining and Botany up to date as well.
If not, you will be buying a lot of materials you could farm for yourself.
FFXIV Guild has [Botany](http://www.ffxivguild.com/ff14-botany-botanist-leveling-guide-a-realm-reborn/)
and [Mining](http://www.ffxivguild.com/ff14-mining-miner-leveling-guide-a-realm-reborn/) leveling guides.

### Post-70

Once you reach 70, you'll need to get a few more things squared away
to make the high-level recipes.
This will involve grinding collectible items for scrip,
farming ephemeral and legendary nodes,
and learning recipes.

#### Red and Yellow Scrip

[Scrip](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Scrips) is a custom currency for crafters and gatherers.
In Stormblood, it comes in two flavors: Red (basic) and Yellow (advanced).
Crafters and gatherers have separate scrip types which cannot be exchanged.
That is, Red Crafter's Scrip (for example) is not the same as Red Gatherer's Scrip.

To obtain scrip, look at the Timer (control-U on PC), then click on Rowena's House of Splendors.
Or talk to the Collectible Appraiser vendor in Rhalgar's Reach.
This will tell you the items you can deliver for the day to receive scrip.
Your goal is usually to make a lot of the item that'll deliver the most value while requiring the fewest materials.
The turn-in items for scrip change daily at 1 AM, so check each day before you start crafting.

Craft these items the same way you would try to create any other HQ item,
but with the [Collectable Synthesis](http://xivdb.com/action/4564/collectable+synthesis) ability activated.
See the "Rotations" section below for suggested rotations to make HQ items.
This process results in an item with a "Collectibility Rating".
The minimum rating for an item is shown in the Timer window along with the item name.
If you make something that doesn't meet the required rating,
you can downgrade it to NQ versions by right-clicking on it and selecting "Lower Quality".

#### Master Recipes and Regional Folklore

The [Splendors Vendor](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Splendors_Vendor_(Rhalgr%27s_Reach))
in Rhalgar's Reach (X: 9, Y: 12) sells six fieldcraft items:
Tomes of Geological, Botanical, and Ichthyological folklore for Gyr Abania and Othard.
Each tome costs 50 [Rowena's Token (Regional Folklore)].
These tokens are sold by the [Scrip Exchange](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Scrip_Exchange_(Rhalgr%27s_Reach)) vendor a few doors down, 50 Red Scrip per token.
Thus, you'll need 2500 Red Gatherers' Scrip per Tome, or 15,000 for all of them.
For most crafting needs, you only need the Geological and Botanical Tomes.

The Scrip Exchange vendor also sells Master V recipe books
for all crafting professions, costing 900 Red Crafter's Scrip apiece.
These contain the level 70 two-star recipes you want to eventually make.

#### Specialization

**Note:** Specialization is _optional_ for all the rotations given in this guide.

You can use the [Specialist System](http://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Specialist_System)
to specialize in up to three crafting classes.
These work very similar to combat jobs: you get an equippable soul, along with some new abilities.
Having the soul equipped also gives you +20 to both Craftsmanship and Control.

What should you specialize in?
I recommend Alchemy, Goldsmithing, and Weaving if you are trying to do it all yourself,
as these classes create most of the precursors for high-level recipes.

You can spend red scrip to change your specialization later.
See the wiki page for details.

### Material Gathering

The most useful tool for gathering from ephemeral and legendary nodes
is [Garland Tools](https://www.garlandtools.org/bell/).
The site includes maps, rotations, and timers for rare nodes.
Other sites, like [FFXIV Clock](ffxivclock.com/#/),
also include timers, but Garland Tools pulls it all together.

Special nodes come in three varieties: Ephemeral, Legendary, and Unspoiled.
Ephemeral and Unspoiled nodes will appear for anyone, but only at specific times.
Legendary nodes require that you acquire Regional Folklore books for them.

Each node hides its contents behind "out of reach" barriers,
which you must click on to reveal the item.
However, specific items are always in the same slot,
so just look at Garland Tools to be sure.
For example, Chromite Ore is always in slot 6 of its Legendary node.
When harvesting, click once to reveal, then do your rotation as shown in the tool -
depending on whether you want collectibles,
aetherial reduction, scrip, or just the item itself.

For collectible gathering for red or yellow scrip, or for crystal farming,
you'll want to use specific rotations depending on what you want to obtain.
Sometimes you want more of an item, while other times you want to maximize the rating of the items you get.

Here's the 4.0 collectable rotations: https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/8444495/blog/2596906/

Here's an ephemeral rotation for 4.05: https://imgur.com/a/feaks

#### Aetherial Reduction

You'll be doing a lot of farming for crystals and clusters.
FFXIV includes a tool to help you acquire these very quickly:
[Aetherial Reduction](http://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Aetherial_Reduction).
You must be level 56 or higher, and complete a quest, to unlock this.
See the link for details.

After this, you'll harvest specific items from Ephemeral Nodes that periodically appear.
Use Garland Tools to time the appearance of these nodes.
The list of nodes, and what you get through reduction,
can be found [here](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Ephemeral_Nodes).

When you see an Ephemeral Node on your map,
make sure [Collector's Glove](http://xivdb.com/action/4074/collector's+glove) is active, then harvest from the node.

Once the node is exhausted, you can force it to respawn, by tapping nodes from two nearby groups.
In Stormblood, like Heavensward, nodes appear together in groups.
You don't have to fully harvest these nodes, just hit them once.
For example, you might fly west of the Ephemeral Node, tap one regular node,
then fly east to the other group and tap another node there.
Doing this will respawn the Ephemeral Node.
Repeat until your bags are full or the node goes away.

Once you have harvested the collectibles,
right-click on them in your bag and select "Aetherial Reduction".

Ephemeral Nodes will continue to spawn for four hours Eorzea time.

#### Aethersands

Many high-level recipes call for one or more types of "Aethersand".
These can be obtained by Aetherial Reduction,
following the process described above.
The rotation for Aethersand reduction is different than for scrip.
Check Garland Tools for details.

You can find the complete list of Aethersands,
along with notes on how and when to find them,
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6ne73j/shiny_new_aethersands_and_where_to_find_them/).

#### Demimateria

Materia are equippable on items.
Demimateria, however, are crafting ingredients.
They are obtained via [Desynthesis](https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Desynthesis).

Essentially, Desynthesis converts a regular item into a related raw material.
For example, a hempen robe might turn into hempen yarn.
You can desynth numerous items, but only a few provide something useful (like demimateria).
Simply right-click on an item in your inventory, and click "Desynthesize".

You level up desynthesis by using it.
There's an excellent [end-game guide](http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/181498-Desynthesis-Endgame-Guide),
updated for patch 3.0, which will get you through the low levels.

Because you can only max out your Desynth skill for three crafting classes,
think carefully about the sorts of items you want to destroy,
and the type of demimateria or other item you want to obtain.
Only ALC and LTW don't have source for a Mastercraft Demimateria.

### Getting Geared

Your goal is to reach at least 290 equipped with your crafting gear.
I did this by creating HQ 290 gear myself, made by WVR, LTW, and CRP.
You can see this gear here, along with recommended melds: [http://ffxiv.ariyala.com/11VCH](http://ffxiv.ariyala.com/11VCH).

In addition to this gear, the Scrip Exchange vendor in Rhalgar's Reach sells level 300 items for Yellow Scrip.
The main hand tools cost 1300 scrip apiece, while completely outfitting yourself in the gear for a single class costs 2400 scrip.
I personally opted for a universally usable crafting set,
so I crafted the 290 gear and am buying the yellow scrip tools.
You must still craft or buy offhands yourself, so don't neglect BSM too.

#### Materia

The recommended melds above came from
[Katya's post](http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/337993-Stormblood-1%2A-and-2%2A-Crafting-Macros)
and cost me about 4 million gil.
If you don't have the gil to spare,
you can buy IV and V grade materia for red scrip
from the Rhalgr's Reach vendor.
IV costs 25, V costs 400.

You might find it cheaper to pursue the Yellow Scrip gear,
but grinding crafting with Potent Spiritbond Potions
active should let you convert your spiritbound gear
and either use it or sell it as necessary.

Either way, check the rotations below for minimum stats,
and make sure you meet those stats.

### Rotations

At 70, I use three rotations for crafting, depending on what I'm making.
I used these to craft my HQ 290 gear.

Credit for the 40 and 80 durability macros goes to Mahiko,
in the [FFXIV Guild Leveling Guide](https://www.ffxivguild.com/ffxiv-wvr-weaver-leveling-guide-ffxivarr/6/).
Credit for the two-star macro goes to Katrisa Ashe of Ultros,
posting at [Stormblood 1* and 2* Macros](http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/337993-Stormblood-1%2A-and-2%2A-Crafting-Macros).

Break these into separate macros, separated by the `/echo` lines.
Also, don't forget to make sure your cross-class skills
include every ability named in the macro!
That includes Comfort Zone, Ingenuity II, Byregot's Blessing, Steady Hand II,
Muscle Memory, Innovation, Waste Not, and Piece by Piece.

Here's a macro that'll set up everything you need:

```
/aaction clear
/aaction "Waste Not" on
/aaction "Comfort Zone" on
/aaction "Piece by Piece" on
/aaction "Flawless Synthesis" on
/aaction "Steady Hand II" on
/aaction "Ingenuity" on
/aaction "Ingenuity II" on
/aaction "Innovation" on
/aaction "Byregot's Blessing" on
/aaction "Muscle Memory" on
/echo Cross-class action setup complete <se.1>
```

When making gear of your level, you will often need crafter food to boost your stats.
[Tempura Platter](http://xivdb.com/item/19826/tempura+platter) is what I use for all HQ and high-level recipes.
It is available for sale in Kugane, from the Independent Culinarian at the market.

#### 40 Durability

Minimum stats: 407 CP (including food).
Use NQ Tempura Platter as your food.
Use this for precursor materials (cloth, ingots, alchemy, etc.).

Use NQ Tempura Platter as your food.
Use this for non-Master recipes.

```
/ac "Muscle Memory" <wait.3>
/ac "Comfort Zone" <wait.2>
/ac "Inner Quiet" <wait.2>
/ac "Steady Hand II" <wait.2>

/ac "Careful Synthesis III" <wait.3>
/ac "Careful Synthesis III" <wait.3>
/ac "Careful Synthesis III" <wait.3>
/echo 80 DUR Part 2 finished <se.14>
```

#### Two-Star

Minimum stats: 1330 Craftsmanship, 510 CP (including food).
Use NQ Tempura Platter as your food (this is not optional).

If you start with about 2000 Quality (which should be easy enough),
this should give you an HQ end product every time.

**Important Note**: you'll need a proc of [Stroke of Genius](http://xivdb.com/action/50351/stroke+of+genius)
to get by with 510 CP - you need 517 without it.
Specialists always proc this ability.
If you don't get it, skip one of the Prudent Touches
at steps 16-20.

```
/ac "Muscle Memory" <me> <wait.3>
/ac "Comfort Zone" <me> <wait.2>
/ac "Inner Quiet" <me> <wait.2>
