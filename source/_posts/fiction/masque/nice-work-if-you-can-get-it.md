I called myself "the Ogre" when I knocked over the bank. It worked for about three minutes, until some yahoo busted through the skylight and took me down. I'm pretty sure that property damage isn't FDIC insured. So why was I the one to go to jail?

The use of superpowers automatically escalates the severity of a crime. Somehow, my public defender convinced the court that I hadn't really ''used'' my power, just shown up and looked mean. Eight feet of rugose chitin is pretty intimidating all by itself. I think it helped that I know words like "rugose" and "chitin", and didn't make a complete ass of myself in court. So I did my five years. The guys I brought with me, who were actually packing heat, got longer. I sort of let them down - I'd promised them I would handle SWAT if it came - but they were lifers anyway. I just needed the money.

When I got out, I went back to the tent city. The economy was getting better by then, so there were fewer faces. I told them what had happened, and what I'd done. Most of them accepted it. A few told me to get lost, that they didn't need me any more. I honestly don't know what they would have said if I'd brought them stolen money. I hadn't thought that far at the time.

Most of these guys don't really understand me. I had one woman, a former carpenter or something, keep telling me she'd read "Frankenstein" and understood what it must be like. There were times I wanted to belt her and yell that she didn't, that nobody could. What stopped me was something important I'd figured out. Maybe these guys didn't understand me, or know me. Maybe it was enough that they accepted me. Nobody else did.

I was bending scrap metal flat one day, when the guy in the suit approached me. I was sure he was from the DA's office at first - my parole officer took a lot of convincing to let me live up at the tent city again - but he gave me a business card. It said "Persona Corporation".

"My name's Lewis," he explained, and shook my hand. I could have crushed every bone in it, and I didn't read a shred of fear on his face. "You're Johnny Kawamura, yeah?"

I was sort of surprised. Nobody called me that, not since I was a kid.

"I'm from Persona," said Lewis. "We got a referral on you. Guys at Twin Towers said you were a model prisoner. Everyone was expecting you to break out any day, but you never did." He stopped me before I got a word out: "I don't care what or why, only wanted to say that we respect that, and that's what got you a job offer."

"A .. job, with Persona?" I was shocked.

Lewis shook his head. "Your record precludes us from employing you at this time." He didn't sound regretful. It came out smooth, prepared. "Employment overseas. A Japanese television production. Something something Coreranger."

"Let me guess. They want me to play a monster."

Lewis grinned. "It's for kids, Mr. Kawamura. Apparently it's a children's show, and the producers gave us a very specific list of criteria. You happen to meet them. It's a one-year contract, options to extend. Maybe some movie deals. Your transportation will be paid for. What do you say?"

I thought it over. I wasn't doing much good to the tent city, and I had a record in the States. It wasn't like I could find work before, either.

"Alright. Hell, I never thought I'd get paid to be a monster."

Lewis's grin faded slightly, but he was still smiling. "Persona deals with masks all the time. Being a monster's just a mask you're stuck wearing."

We went over the details. I checked with my parole officer. The state wasn't happy, but Persona was vouching for me. I had a life again. I had a purpose. I'm getting paid to be a Child of Lilith. Nice work, if you can get it.

On the plane, I found out they'd charged me for a second seat. Something about my size. And I'm the one who got arrested for robbery?
