Ram's body sits in the pod underneath the Persona offices in Chicago. It floats in a liquid suspension, protected with breathing gear and restraining harnesses. Occasionally the muscles will twitch. But Ram isn't there. He's borrowing someone's body.

Three Icons are out in the field: Brawl, Diver, and Skippy. Ram is watching through the eyes of Brawl, the carbon alchemist and strong-man for the Icons.  Right now, what Ram is seeing through Brawl's eyes is a fight.

Like everyone else on the team, Brawl isn't a real person. He's operated by people like Ram via remote. Diver's being operated by a woman Ram has never met named Lenna Lee, whose voice he can hear over his headset in the pod.  Skippy is being run by a trainee agent, whose job it is to watch the proceedings and learn how to be a superhero by proxy.

The fight is happening in downtown Atlanta. Two professional super-assassins, named Needle and Thread, are going up against a local super-vigilante calling himself Flintlock. The police have cordoned off the area. Snipers are on their way, but there are plenty of civilians left in the area. Officially the Icons have been tasked with rescuing them. Unofficially, Lenna and the new guy are itching to go after the terrorists. Ram is getting irritated by this, but says nothing. He's doing his job.

191 Peachtree Tower is a 50-story skyscraper. The ground floor is already blocked off by rubble, so Ram has been directing Brawl in clearing it away so that civilians can be escorted out. The still-burning shell of a fire engine is testament to the problems of having conventional EMS personnel do this job - Needle and Thread want hostages, and Flintlock is already pulling his punches.

Ram isn't sure how it happens, but he happens to be looking up to see the outcome. Something blows a big hole in the side of 191, about midway up the building. There's a shower of glass that'll start raining down. That's not what worries Ram - Brawl is a fast healer, and the others are out of the way already. What he does see is a pair of human bodies flung out into space.

"Ops fast switch," he barks, not engaging Brawl's voice - this will only be heard by the operations team. "Skip." Instantly his perspective shifts. He's taken over Skippy's body, and the power Skippy has is to bounce. As combat powers go, it's not so interesting. That's why skilled agents take pride in finding uses for it.

He runs at best speed towards Brawl - himself, until a moment ago. He leaps. "Brawl," he calls into his headset in the pod, and finds himself about to be hit by a flying trainee. But he's ready. Brawl grabs Skippy, flings him up into the air. "Dive," he calls again. The third Icon, Diver, is on the roof of the building next door, and she's got a grappling gun. He raises her arm, fires the gun, stays just long enough to note the trajectory.

"Skip." He's in the air now, watching a line sail past beneath him. Lenna Lee's angry voice is on the headset; he ignores her. The trainee has the good sense to keep his mouth shut. He grabs at one of the falling civilians, catches her, pushes off the glass of the building to angle himself down to grab the other. Skippy's kinetic redirection powers respond instantly to his command.

The second civilian is in hand, but Skippy's now got his hands full. "Dive," calls Ram, leaping off the building as Diver and thumbing the line retraction button on the grappling gun. He's got the timing right, he thinks. Diver takes the falling glass and flaming debris full in the back, and it hurts a lot. But the civilians are safe, which is the point.

"Skip." Skippy lands, bounces, aims for the nearby roof. He lets go of the civilians immediately and flips again to Brawl. He blanks on the trainee's name, feels bad for a moment. "Skippy, calm them down. Tell them that EMS is on the way, and that you'll keep them safe." The trainee, in a shaky voice, complies.

"Good job," comes Lenna's voice. She didn't see them fall, Ram tells himself, realizing. She stopped complaining when she noticed what was happening.

The moment passes. Flintlock manages to blow Needle and Thread into the side of Peachtree; rubble buries them. In the time it'll take for them to heal up and get out, the police cordon - and Brawl and Diver - will be ready. Rescue services can do their work for the civilians. And Ram breathes a sigh of relief.
