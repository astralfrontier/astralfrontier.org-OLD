Apollo
------

This piece was meant to evoke the tone of Astro City: people with human problems and realities in a world with superhumans. Apollo wishes to continue space exploration, but feels held back by his NASA sponsors.

Exodus
------

Exodus is an example of the problem confronting law enforcement: how do you restrain a super? One of the strongest incentives to perform basic research into powers (such as Subject 5 at IBM, described earlier) is to give mundanes a tool to restrain rogue supers.

Unlike characters such as Victor Ballard (described earlier), who can hopefully be controlled by social pressures, Exodus would need to be physically restrained (or kept sedated) to keep him in jail. Other super-criminals will similarly not care about what society thinks of them, and will try to escape if possible.

Faduma
------

This piece was written with George R. R. Martin's character Daenerys Targaryen as a model - someone who makes deep sacrifices and does unpleasant things in the name of a future peace.

Frank
-----

Frank is a Child of Lilith. Although he might be able to put his powers to more practical or beneficial uses, he isolates himself due to fear of rejection.

Juan Pablo Camacho was born in a Chilean base in Antarctica. More [here](http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/8409).

Harry Franklin
--------------

Harry isn't a super, he's a technician who interacts with them.

Subject 5 is intended to be "typical" of supers - someone with powers who isn't predisposed by personality to either heroism or villainy. Whether her current situation is good or bad is one of the central ethical questions of the game.

Jerome Washington
-----------------

This piece was partially written to illustrate ways to circumvent the meta-origin of the setting to accomplish an apparently impossible ability like "mind control".

The Stargate Project is described [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Project).

The Transhuman Capability Catalog is described [here](http://masque.astralfrontier.org/index.php/Transhuman_Capability_Catalog).

What Tim says about telepathy is mostly accurate (in-universe), with his own anti-religious spin put on it.

The Jersey Devil
----------------

The Jersey Devil is a Child of Lilith, described [here](http://masque.astralfrontier.org/index.php/Children_of_Lilith).

Not all Lilim are mindless brutes or savages; see Frank, later on, for a more sympathetic variety.

Mack Atlas
----------

Mack is an example of a "working super": someone who gets paid to put their powers to use. His employer/super-team, the MTF, is described [here](http://masque.astralfrontier.org/index.php/Metahuman_Task_Force).

The earlier pipe bomb that damaged the AT&T building is talked about [here](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,354155,00.html).

The CSLB is the Contractors State License Board, whose home page is [here](http://www.cslb.ca.gov/).

Victor Ballard
--------------

Victor's crime is exacerbated by his presumed use of powers. The prosecutor will use this fact to strengthen his case, meaning Victor's defense lawyer was very good to reduce the charges as much as he did.
