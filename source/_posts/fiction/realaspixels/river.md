Around the castle, at the base of the tree, is a river. Sometimes the river overflows its banks; other times it's a tranquil flow of pure water. The stones of the castle were carried on its currents.

Once upon a time, an explorer decided to find what lay at the head of the river - after all, water comes from somewhere. In his journal he reports that he found a natural spring. Later generations treasured it. A few unwise industrialists have tried to excavate it to discover the secret. But the river never stopped flowing.
