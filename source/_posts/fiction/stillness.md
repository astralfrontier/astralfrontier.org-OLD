Did I go mad then, or now?

I remember the night my wife died.
The car accident was probably unavoidable.
She was driving carefully, but it was dark and rainy.
I was exhausted from my long day, and half-asleep in the back.

I was discharged from the hospital with only minor injuries.
I was unconscious while the surgeons tried to save her.
I attended grief counseling, but something in me had just snapped.
The world didn't make sense any more.
What used to be reality felt no more authentic
than a nightmare from which I couldn't wake.

I started delving into anything that promised me hope.
Seances, channeling, alternate religions.
We had never been particularly religious people,
but I alone didn't have her common sense reining in my flights of fancy.
My frantic search for answers took me further and further afield.

Finally I attended a seminar on "revised relativity".
The speaker was a Dr. Henry Churnow of Princeton University.

"Spacetime," he told us, "is a four-dimensional construct.
Matter does not move through three dimensions.
Matter doesn't _move_ at all.
It's just a line from here to there.
Our cosmos is a single, motionless, very complicated work of art."

"If you stepped out of time,
and looked at the line of your life, it might resemble
one of those frozen scenes from an action movie.
You could witness your own body as a still life at every stage of development.
Here, your childhood self bleeds into your teenage years.
There, you could run a hand across the smoothly continuous
surface of your transition from adulthood to middle age.
The passing of years is a distance,
fundamentally no different than driving for miles in your car."

"This is counter-intuitive,
because nobody experiences their life as a motionless scene.
We now understand that the same quantum fluctuations which
give rise to virtual particles in space
also spontaneously create waves in time.
These waves create ripples in the diorama,
an effect we understand as consciousness."

"Because your body is a solid object in four-dimensional
spacetime, this means your consciousness
can traverse the line of your life as easily as it inspects
sensations at every part of your body.
This happens unconsciously, when you remember,
but because memories themselves are encoded chemically
in the neurons of your brain,
you forget that you've essentially traveled in time."

"The diorama is not _entirely_ motionless.
Every intersection of waves, such as those that make up
your body, and those that make up your mind,
has an effect on the whole.
I said that you could run a hand across your spatio-temporal surface
of the whole of your physical existence?
What were to happen if you gave it a slight push?"

The rest of the presentation went over my head.
I'm an engineer, not a physicist.
But the whole idea sounded too incredible.
Conscious quantum fluctuations pervading the universe?
Traveling backward in time, visiting the past, resonating with local matter,
only to forget you'd done it?

Did I go mad then,
when I first sought out such insane outlets for my grief,
with their impossible promises of life after death?
Or have I gone mad now,
as I enter my house and faint in shock at seeing my wife working in the kitchen?
