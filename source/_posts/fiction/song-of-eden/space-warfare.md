Bill says, "Space war in Song of Eden. Because you have an FTL drive that simply magnifies your forward motion, your trajectory will be easily predictable. If you were moving along a given vector, nothing but rockets will adjust that. But you can toggle the drive on and off, so that motion prediction will be unreliable."

Bill says, "Because of that, I think the only place you can reliably shoot at another ship is from behind them. If you're in front of them, great, but you risk a collision doing that. Then again, for a relatively small target, maybe you want that."

Bill says, "A ship only interested in escaping a fight can do so pretty easily; just engage engines and pray their enemies can't keep up. The only reason to make small, controlled leaps forward is if you intend to shoot back."

Bill says, "The place where you can't effectively use this defensive tactic is when nearby space is cluttered up. Thus, clouds of ships a la Star Wars or other scifi is unlikely; you don't bunch up when any one of those ships might suddenly jump forward in space."

Phil says, "Maybe not Star Wars, but the photon torpedo might work - an FTL smart missile."

Phil says, "That can follow a ship doing requant. Though it would probably take more than one to guarantee a kill."

Phil says, "So... maybe more like Itano Circus/Macross Missile Massacre."

Bill says, "Yeah. that's still effectively a race between ships, only your 'ship' is small, hopefully well-equipped with an energy reserve, and expendable."

Bill says, "To maximize its maneuverability, you use nuclear payloads for the weight-to-yield ratio."

Bill says, "You want really awesome IFF, or your enemy ship will maneuver past one of your friendlies and try to catch him in the blast."

Bill says, "One model that I imagined was sort of like two swordsmen fighting in a high-powered wuxia show. You know, darting through trees, evading each other, circling each other, until they finally get close enough and one delivers the killing blow. The ships know their delta-V budget for killing the other guy, know how much energy they can divert into their drives, use their surroundings intelligently, and so on."

Bill says, "You'll see that sort of dogfighting in Macross generally, but it's saved for the fighters.  With an FTL drive, I think it's applicable at most scales."

Bill says, "Based on the ship stats from GURPS, it seems like delta-V is a precious commodity for any engine with any reasonable acceleration (> 0.001 G), so I think the thing you'll run out of first is fuel."

Phil says, "Sounds like it's still the traditional depiction of 'hard' space warfare... orbits, delta-vees, and so on."

Phil says, "But even more like 'Das Boot' because the distances are far beyond one gravity well."

Phil says, "Like, space warefare near Earth? Boring. Because things can't really 'dodge' and it would take DAYS to chase each other down."

Bill says, "Yeah, there's no reactionless drive as such. the FTL drive gets you further on a tank of fuel but still requires power (and usually more than your power plant can offer unless you take the Slow Boat To China). So most of your defenses are in orbit, the place where spaceships want to land - if that's what you're trying to stop."

Bill says, "Kinetic-kill attacks against planets are a distinct possibility. You can warp in, undetected unless the system has an outer perimeter watching for people flashing past. You will need a shitload of fuel and power to lob anything really big."
