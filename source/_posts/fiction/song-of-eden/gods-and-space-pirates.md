Being a god will not stop you from being kidnapped by space pirates.

Space piracy sounds like the sort of thing that shouldn't work. A modern starship travels many times the speed of light, and space is very big. Just finding a ship, much less docking with it in transit, ought to be impossible. But anything that's impossible is bound to succeed, because nobody prepares for it. So here's how the pirates do it.

First, some background. A starship is just a rocket with a field generator attached to it. Faster-Than-Light, or FTL, systems come in many shapes and sizes. They have clever names alluding to their function, or brand names from a given manufacturer or evolutionary line. But they all work mostly the same. When turned on, local space-time comes unstuck and starts sliding over the larger manifold like a greased cat on a tile floor. Whatever velocity your rocket gave you is magnified based on drive power.

FTL speed is measured in orders of magnitude, called "O notation". "Order 6" or "O6" travel - ten to the sixth power, or one million - means that every mile per second of velocity moves you across a million miles of space in that second. This bothers a lot of amateur physicists, until they understand that you're not accelerating through space, you're lugging space around with you.

To make this work, you need a lot of electricity. Starships store their power in big cylindrical capacitors, armored to the gills, and they discharge that juice over the course of their flight. Capacitors get recharged from power plants. But no ship has a big enough fusion reactor to do that at interstellar speeds. You can store electricity much more compactly than you can store a machine that makes more. So you recharge on a planet.

Remember how I said FTL drives magnify existing velocity? To save on power and hence go further, you want to go as fast as you want, so stopping to recharge is unacceptable. So, in advance, you work out a schedule for capacitor hot-swap.

"Capacitor hot-swap" is one of those phrases that separates the men from the boys, the experienced starhand from the novice, the quick from the dead. Casual planet-dwellers hear the phrase and go "huh?". Typical interplanetary space crews, the guys that never leave their tiny solar system, go "yeah, we trade capacitors every week", because they do, only it's handled once they're nice and safe and inert at a dock. Typical military crews get that tight, strained smile that means they don't want to think about it because it always goes smoothly and you're gonna jinx them so shut your mouth already, you son of a bitch.

You don't meet typical members of the group for whom it went wrong.

Most people that need to travel really long distances - like "across a map of the galaxy" long - are aboard military craft, high-priority couriers, or scout ships. They are people for whom fresh intelligence is vital. They follow pre-planned routes with mathematically exact precision. They use the very latest in atomic clocks, relativity-adjusted, and the very finest products of astronomy and stellar cartography. They hate devil-may-care, seat-of-your-pants, Right Stuff piloting. They have found religion. Most of them regard the need to actually operate the ship's controls as a sign that some part of the process has fundamentally failed. All of them are at the controls when the time comes, just in case it did.

A ship comes out of FTL on approach to a planet, moon, sun, or other roughly spherical, predictable body at speeds which the term "high" is inadequate to describe, ready to do a move called (with exaggerated casualness) "a slingshot". It's got a respectably scary amount of momentum, thanks to a furiously incandescent burn that ate about half the fuel supply and left bruises on the unprepared.

Those engines have long since been shut off. Now it's just attitude control jets. The ship angles itself, making last-minute corrections at the celestial entity drawing closer at distressing speed. Assuming there is one. If a pilot's luck is really bad, he'll be staring at the emptiness of space, where he has absolutely no chance of crashing into anything. He got pulled off course along the way by a previously-uncharted gravity well, like a rogue planet or something. That object will now bear his name forever, thanks to vengeful mapmakers who like immortalizing dead idiots. But usually there's a planet.

The people orbiting this planet see this ship come, blam, out of nowhere. Because it did. They don't see it approaching because the light from when it was traveling, y'know, faster than light, hasn't caught up yet. So they see this ship materialize like a fast-moving ghost, and its past images receding into the deep black. Two ships where there was none before, one going forward in time, one going back, like quantum pair production.

The ship flips its belly to the stars and ejects its now-empty capacitors away from the planet. They float away, to be collected and recharged for use by the next crew of maniacs to swing by like this. The ship then rolls over, and waits. What's it waiting for? The spare capacitors.

The spares will have been launched ahead of time, matching velocity with whatever was written up in the schedule for that ship. And the ship had better be going at that speed, and be in that place, or someone's getting fired. If it's there, the ship maneuvers to clamp onto the spares and pull them into itself. Click, clank, locked, loaded. If this part goes wrong, someone's probably salvaging spaceship wreckage from orbit, or charting trajectories of descent, or organizing civilian evacuations of likely landing sites. Only after all that unfortunate business is squared away does someone get fired. That's why most slingshots happen around uninhabited planets.

When the new capacitors are locked in place, the rockets pick up again. The ship goes faster and faster as the planet draws it in, a gravitational harlot offering speed in exchange for whispered promises of a fiery crash. But the ship pulls out at the last second, the cad, and the FTL drive kicks in again. The ship is on its way. Nothing can stop it now. Except FTL engine failure in the middle of the deep black or something.

A ship's inherited inertia stays with it, which is another reason to use planets for slingshots. You can slowly get yourself flying about as fast as wherever you're going. If you were rocketing west - for whatever definition of "west" makes you happy - then crossing the galaxy to where everything is moving "east" at 240 kilometers per second leaves you with an incredible amount of speed compared to anything there, and very few people have the fuel tanks to supply the truly heroic quantity of delta-v needed to fix that.

So let's ignore that 99% of the time a ship is in flight between planets, out in the deep cold black between stars. To swap capacitors, they have to be in a certain place at a certain time. And there's one object they absolutely welcome aboard their ship - the spare capacitor. The essence of piracy is getting some guys onto some other guys' ship. Are ships' capacitors big enough to hold some guys? They are.

So now you know how space piracy works.

You only need three things to be a space pirate. First, you need to be missing that part of normal peoples' brains that kicks in when you do dumb things and tells you to stop. Second, you need a really incredibly good level of access to ship schedules. And third, you need enough muscle to suborn the normal hot swap procedure, because the crews wrangling the capacitors aren't just standing around wearing labels reading "HI MY NAME IS Victim".

Unfortunately, the sort of people who will try this are not the sort to be intimidated by hearing "I am a god", even if it's strictly only half true. I'm the genetic clone of a god, and technically a clone of a demigod at that. Luckily for me, the actual gods who came to Earth a millennium ago instilled a great respect for human life into mankind that's persisted to this day. Even space pirates won't kill captives. They're restrained while their ship is looted, or held for ransom, or just bagged because they seem interesting enough to schlep along.

So now you know how I got kidnapped by space pirates.

# Gods and Fate 

Before the advent of Earth's gods, there were a lot of theories about where you go when you die. Afterlives of every description were proposed by priests and shamans and other such holy men, and most of them amounted to "whatever a successful person of my culture would enjoy in life, only more of it and for longer". Sometimes you got different levels of afterlife depending on whether you were really good or just polite, or how much you'd paid the church, or based on your horoscope sign. But virtually all of them were sponsored by one or more of the gods of the adherent's religion.

We know now that the truth is a variation of reincarnation. The component souls that become a human being split off and go their separate ways. The memories of the old life are washed clean, allowing the soul to take on a new fate and tell a new story. Fine, but what's a soul? The gods were a little vague on that point, but they weren't around long enough for a really serious theological discussion on the point. There was some talk of a "true afterlife", a paradise where souls living and dead would gather again. The gods promised us we could find it, if we looked.

The one thing they were very clear on was this: souls become living humans to experience something in the life they receive. Everyone around you, literally everyone, is alive for a reason. Ironically, knowing that there was something that happened to you after death made us a lot more respectful of life.

Where does a god go when he dies? If there really is an afterlife, is there a god of gods that welcomes wayward deities home? If a god reincarnates, does he become another type of god? I wasn't eager to find out. So when the pirate captain pointed the weird black box at me and said "surrender or die", I smiled and raised my hands.

We seemed equally surprised to see each other, but I give the man credit for presence of mind. He didn't say "who are you" ("I'm Isaac Gregory") or "what are you doing here" (a truly complicated question) or "this ship was supposed to be unmanned" (technically true). He just motioned with his weapon toward the maintenance hatch where he and his crew had come aboard, which is the universal gesture among armed people for "move your ass".

I got to watch the next step in the pirates' plan. They couldn't afford to take their eyes off me, so I had to be around when they did their thing. Their pirate capacitor was really an unpowered lifeboat, with air reserves and seats and high-G restraint straps, but it did have a smaller capacitor bolted in. The captain watched me while his three crew started connecting their capacitor to the FTL drive's mains.

Truth be told, I wasn't fully convinced the thing he held was a weapon. Space is big, technology is ever-evolving. He could have been threatening me with a cookbook and I'd gone along with it on the strength of the hijacking they just performed. But what they were doing was interesting enough that I thought it worth waiting out.

With the connection made, the captain handed off his laser, or cookbook, or whatever it was, and got on the command board. The ship started rotating on its attitude jets, then began a burn. They were going somewhere, and I was going along. Maybe this was the fate my soul had sought out. If so, we were going to have a long and earnest conversation.
