AST-3000-231 is the 231st mission using Atlantis Space Transfer (AST) technology,
specifically a Living Leviathan, in the year 3000.
It is scheduled to launch on June 4, 3000 at 4:45 a.m.
The mission is also referred to as Vareid-6261 by Vareid Orbital aerospace control.
The mission objectives are to transfer military personnel and equipment to
Vareid Orbital Habitats #5, #6, and #7 and to return with planetbound personnel.
Mission parameters were amended at the request of Vareid aerospace control
to fire non-nuclear rockets at a mass of orbital debris and to track the
re-entry of this debris.
