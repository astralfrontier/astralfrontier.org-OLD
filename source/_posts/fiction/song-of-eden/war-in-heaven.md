The *Scarlet Saber* rested easily in the asteroid belt. Intelligence indicated that the system was being used as a base for pirates. It was now or never – if the pirates could be caught with empty capacitors, they couldn’t escape.

The far-flung web of sensors sounded the alarm – arrival of a starship. Coordinates began pouring in. The *Saber* ignited its engines. The fusion reactor went to 120% output. The pirate ship, already on the far side of the asteroid belt, didn’t yet know what was approaching.

The captain of the *Saber* spoke to his crew. "They have killed people. Civilians. It's up to us to stop them before they get out of the system again. They just got here – so their capacitors are dry." And saying that, he pressed two buttons on his console. The first switched the *Scarlet Saber* into its combat posture - ship's systems began to change, power allocations were rerouted, weapons were warmed up. The second sealed the fate of one of the two ships: it was the instruction to commit nuclear resources to the combat program that was now locked in. Everyone was strapped in and braced for acceleration. What was to come would be too intense for humans to direct – the ship itself would fight, and its crew would live or die with it. The crew’s tasks had been research, theorizing, and guesswork. There was nothing left for them to do but test their fate against their opponent.

In seconds the craft’s combat instincts flashed it across an astronomical unit of space. Two missiles let fly, and the pirates knew they were under attack. Nuclear blossoms lit up the starry night – evaded only by the microsecond reflexes of the pirates’ own ship.

The enemy took off, the *Saber* after it. The ship let out a roar and changed course, attempting to take up a position on its opponent’s tail. The pirates swung around a large asteroid; the *Saber* powered up its thrusters still further, spending precious delta-V to stay behind it, where a clean shot was possible. The crew began to experience blackouts. Those that were still conscious looked up on the main display, where the ship was grimly solving the equations of motion for its opponent.

The pirate disappeared briefly – a controlled series of FTL jumps, landing precisely in places blocked from the *Saber's* line of sight by asteroids. The *Saber* launched disposable fragments of itself, equipped with radio transceivers and sensors. The engines shut off; the ship waited. Soon one of the pirate’s afterimages reached the fragments; *Saber* wheeled, angrily jettisoning a cargo module to reduce its mass and assist with course correction. Geometry calculations flashed across the displays. Computation time was pegged almost at 100% to find the pirate.

There! The other ship had been spotted well enough to solve for its next position accurately. The *Saber* screamed and leaped. Three more nuclear missiles fled its tubes. Two spent themselves on empty space, but a third hit the next asteroid in the pirate’s jump line. Debris – the surviving matter on the outermost edges of the shock wave – flew in all directions. But the pirate had been caught indirectly, hit by asteroid fragments from the rock which had shielded it until a moment ago.

Over the horizon of a nearby asteroid the *Saber* rose, an avenging angel in the cold darkness, bringing Heaven’s wrath with it. Lasers trained themselves on the pirate, still red-hot and radiant from the blast. Computations and estimates took fractions of a millisecond – probability of having a laser-reflective web versus energy required for FTL escape. The decision came. The *Saber's* photon blades lanced out. Holes burned into the pirate, aimed precisely where the FTL drive field emitters should be. They hit. One more missile and it was over.

The *Saber's* crew slowly recovered from the ordeal. The captain was first, and he was still studying the fight his ship had won as the other crewmen came round. “Good work, everyone,” he managed at last. He reached out and patted the worn and dirty command console with a leathery hand. "And you too, my old friend."
