I've been invited to run [Inept Sorcerers] at [GeekGirlCon] this year,
October 10 and 11.
During the sessions, I'll be testing out one of the "frames" for the game,
called *Race For the Crown*.

<!-- more -->

Race For the Crown is intended to be a kid-friendly, light-hearted game.
The premise is that magical royal siblings have been told by their
parents, the rulers of a magical kingdom, that the succession to the throne
is in the hands of whoever uses their power to do the most good for the kingdom.

The kids will have to work to identify the dangers the kingdom faces,
find ways to make their magic solve those dangers,
and make sure their power doesn't go too far or do something unexpected.
Along the way, they'll hopefully learn some life lessons about
magic and responsibility.

I'm still writing RFTC, but it's probably not more than two pages' different
from Inept Sorcerers itself.
