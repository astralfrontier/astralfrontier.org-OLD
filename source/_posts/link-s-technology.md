This is a run-down of the battlesuit and technology [Link](/2017/08/07/link/) uses.

<!-- more -->

The Link Suit is a set of powered armor. It's designed to defeat high-tech weapon users or powered supervillains.
By combining his suit with his robot companions, Link can scale the suit's power level from human-scale to giant-scale.
The suit has no weapons. Its goal is capture and containment.

The Suit's technology is based on light elements: hydrogen, carbon, and so on.
Carbon allotropes provide energy storage, armor, and artificial musculature.

### Armor

The armor is built of layers of self-healing [nanotubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanotube)
and [graphene](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/bend-it-charge-it-dunk-it-graphene-the-material-of-tomorrow/) sheets,
under a super-dense skin of [carbon tetrahedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdense_carbon_allotropes).
The suit coats the wearer in a [shear thickening fluid](http://science.howstuffworks.com/liquid-body-armor1.htm) (STF) to resist physical damage.
It uses a layer of insulating [carbon nanofoam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanofoam) to resist energy attacks.

The suit's durable graphene-nanotube hybrid structure acts as
[dilatant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilatant) with an effective surface area 120,000 times that of conventional armor.
This provides safety against attacks, as well as resistance to long falls and heavy impacts.
It includes bladders that can expand and put pressure on specific areas of the body, similar to flight suits used by fighter pilots,
to keep the operator from blacking out in high-gravity maneuvers.

The suit's muscles are a [nanotube yarn](http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/nov/16/nanotube-yarn-flexes-its-muscles),
with 200 times the lifting capacity of human muscle. 
Based on its current structural strength, the suit can lift 10 to 20 tons at best.

### Skyhook System

The suit is equipped with six highly fiexible grappling-hook systems, called "skyhooks".
The skyhooks can be used offensively or defensively, and allow the suit to move rapidly through swinging.

There are six skyhook launchers: two on the forearms, fixed forward and aimed through the arms,
two turreted launchers on the shoulders, and two more on the hips.
The turreted launchers can rotate 360 degrees with a 90 degree elevation.
 
The launchers fire smart, programmable-matter heads.
Each head can be configured into a variety of shapes:
grappling hooks, restraining claws, cutting blades, blunt impact surfaces, and so on.
The operator can also lock the suit in place for feats of strength by attaching skyhooks to nearby objects.

The suit computer allows the operator to select the appropriate type rapidly.
The operator can aim the skyhooks with a heads-up eye-tracking system.
All-angle vernier thrusters on the heads provide the skyhooks with a terminal guidance system.
They can perform course correction, wrap themselves around targets, and more.
 
The skyhook cables are flexible, electrically conductive nanotubes.
They can be hooked to the suit's power supply, to act as an electric stun weapon,
or siphon power away from an electrified target.

### Power and Propulsion

The suit's power system is based on a piece of ultra-technology known as the "Casimir fractal".
Energy from the Casimir effect is exploitable using quantum dots as wave-guides.
New Casimir fractals can be "bred" from old ones, so as long as one remains intact,
Leo can manufacture more.
He keeps spares located in all of his usual workshops, and one or two in hard-to-guess locations. 
 
The suit uses sheets of graphene, an ultra-high-density electricity storage medium,
to hold power in reserve in case one of the fractals fail.
This provides the suit with about thirty minutes of reserve electrical power.

Otto uses [metastable metallic hydrogen](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3115485)
as a high-energy-density rocket fuel.

### Life Support and Sensors

The suit comes with 30 minutes of independent oxygen. It is sealed and can be used underwater, in the upper atmosphere, and even in space for short periods.
 
The suit includes various long-wear life support affordances (sweat circulation, waste elimination, and the like),
making it comfortable for hours or days if necessary.
The operator must still eat, drink, and sleep as normal. 

The suit has a multi-function sensor suite including infrared and night-vision modes,
similar to the Army's Land Warrior/Future Force Warrior situational awareness system.
