A couple years ago, I moved my blog to Metalsmith.
More recently I decided to try another static site generator, [Hexo](http://hexo.io).
URLs have all changed, so if you are looking for old content, you'll have to search.

Hexo is a lot less flexible than Metalsmith.
It has some interesting features, and bakes in a lot of stuff for you.
I'm going to give it a try for awhile and see what I think.
The more I work with it, though, the more I think that I could put together
a [NoFlo](https://noflojs.org/) or [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) based pipeline
that would give me everything I want.

URLs have all changed.
Hexo, like many blog platforms, apparently doesn't think that users want to tag or categorize pages.
As a result, I moved everything into a blog-post format, with corresponding date-based permalinks.

I'm setting up local site search to help look for older posts,
and will be tagging more stuff as I get a chance.
