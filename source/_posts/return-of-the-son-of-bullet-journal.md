Similar to the [other journal](/2018/11/06/wednesday-d-d-bullet-journal/) I started, here's one for the D&D game running on alternating Sundays, in which I play the character described [here](/2018/11/19/the-emotionally-available-barbarian/).

The barbarian class symbol. This is a simpler journal, hopefully reflecting the sorts of things a troubled boy would care about, rather than the observations of an adult druid.

Rock's father and mother. His parents are very important to him, and we'll get into how they both influenced him as the game progresses (I hope).

A crude sketch of the character's most immediately obvious features (a face-covering scarf and spikey hair). On the right is a pressed flower, given to him in backstory by one of the other PCs. He's not coping well with gifts.

A brief rundown of events from the first session, along with pictures of our opponents (vegepygmies) and a picture I found online that might approximate our starting village.
