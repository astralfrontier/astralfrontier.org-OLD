It's 2017.
I made progress on some projects,
failed to completely push through a few others,
and made some important breakthroughs on even more.
In no particular order, here's what's on my plate at the moment.

<!-- more -->

### Compleat Villain

My general lack of faith in Fate-related supers rules
is pushing me toward the [Masks](http://www.magpiegames.com/masks/) rules.
This mostly affects the villain write-ups,
and may or may not impact the "how to villain" text.
But overall I feel much better about this than statting out villains
in anything else people seem to be playing these days.

### Fairy Soul

I'm feeling better and better about this.
Mostly I need to be sure that the world and setting are well fleshed out,
so I'm going to try and shotgun a few seasons of "Downton Abbey" soon,
as it seems to be on point for the era I want.
I'm not trying to create a historically accurate depiction of the Edwardian
era, only something that feels real enough to game in.

### Grand Adventure

The current incarnation of Actions was not well received,
so I put together a brainstorming document to find fixes.
I have a smoother, more streamlined system that harks back to an old idea:
build a dice pool by figuring out ways your thing _could_ go wrong.
Players roll dice based on their Words, Pools, and any Twists they want to take.
Right now, they also roll based on a player-chosen difficulty number:
the higher the number, the more progress you make but the harder it'll be to roll.
This needs playtesting, and there's several alternatives or tweaks to it.

### Helping Hand

It's hard sometimes, but I still believe in this universe.
I'm going to work on the remainining stories I'd planned out,
writing them as I have free time.
Working with ComiPo or in a comic script format seems to be easier for me,
so I'm going to start with that, rather than the conventional short-story form.

### Mini-Games

I put out two documents for public inspection.

[Blood, Loss](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s8c8-4IQ3ZM4tHqNHiQmdsYXoZApf0AKxat_IszGD6E/edit?usp=sharing)
is a no-dice one-player game about gaining vampire powers and facing mortality.
2016 hit me pretty hard, and this is what came out of that
plus a desire to try and create a "pure story game" (by somebody's definition).
It's still a work in progress - the prompts will need rewriting - but it says something specific that I wanted to say.

[A Long Time Ago](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iLUfAGAoNJz3vYBGDIqRel08Im-Trla5z4Y7J3r-dZo/edit?usp=sharing)
is a tiny game meant to run the Star Wars universe as a series of moral conflicts,
which I think is basically what it is anyway.
People have expressed some interest and given some good feedback,
and I'm working on incorporating that.
