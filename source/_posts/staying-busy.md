The last several weeks have been pretty busy.
I've been slow to post, so here's a recap of recent work.

<!-- more -->

### Attack From the Stars

I created an alien-invasion Fusion AU,
called [Attack From the Stars](/2016/05/21/attack-from-the-stars/).

Some people, including Jacob Possin, expressed interest on Google+ in
running a game based in this timeline.
Jacob's an awesome guy but also a busy one, but if he has time
I look forward to participating in that.

### Avert the Apocalypse

My alternating-Sundays gaming group wasn't satisfied with Fate Accelerated
for the sci-fi game we're playing, called Diaspora.
We took a break to try out [Masks](http://www.magpiegames.com/masks/),
and we got four sessions done.

I think we missed out on a chance to really explore what makes Masks unique,
like the Influence mechanics, but it was educational and fun.

Following that, I put together a short set of rules, called
[Avert the Apocalypse](/assets/rpg/AvertTheApocalypse.pdf),
based on Simple World.
I tried to capture the typical things the Diaspora PCs were doing,
then encode those into stats and moves.
I included a sample character based on my own PC ("D7"),
and a list of sample qualities that are used to build characters.

### Final Fantasy XIV

Since moving into my new house, I haven't been playing much FFXIV
due to a lack of wired Ethernet.
The wireless or Ethernet-over-powerline arrangement I have is very flaky
for sustained MMO gaming.
Still, I made some progress in areas where disconnects aren't fatal.

For example, here's my private chamber decorations:

* [Dinner table](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/494647093074407004/834FB11642381A0282E8C62DAE69A52B2091F56D/)
* [Bed and reading corner](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/487892324732064527/9EA48AF106DB56ACEE8BC0A365B1E81C2D2B1574/)

### Helping Hand visual journal

I'm working on a visual journal for the
[Helping Hand](/2016/02/22/fiction/helping-hand/) super-team,
to flesh out their world and background a bit.

You can see a few
[sample pages](https://plus.google.com/+BillGarrett/posts/CxDNYHV4PvM)
on Google+.

### Overwatch

I bought [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/) and have been
playing, mostly player-vs-AI and solo-AI matches.
I played in a couple of "real" PvP matches and got killed quickly,
but that's expected of a new player without a lot of FPS practice.
It's definitely a fun game and a fun universe,
and it's giving me ideas for how to formulate the process of creating
a new game setting.

### The Party

A friend of mine experienced a personal loss.
In response, I wrote a brief story called [The Party](/2016/05/19/fiction/the-party/).
It seems to have been well received.

### Words as Approaches

I wrote a suggestion for using
[Words over Approaches](https://plus.google.com/+BillGarrett/posts/ZzERjDqwiXH)
on Google+.
I'm thinking more about the comments that it received,
which suggested looking at it as a possible magic system.
