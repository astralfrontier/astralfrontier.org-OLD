A "fusion AU" - a combination of many fictional franchises into a single chronology -
based on the theme of biology. Viral infections, nonhuman creatures or half-human hybrids, giant monsters, and more.

Prelude (antiquity - 1945)
--------------------------

Since ancient times, certain humans have been immortal. ^[[Helix: Immortals](http://helix.wikia.com/wiki/Immortals)]
In later centuries, they would learn the reason: an infection by a strain of the
"Progenitor virus". ^[[Progenitor Virus](http://residentevil.wikia.com/wiki/Progenitor_virus)]
Aside from longevity, the virus conveys a healing
factor, immense physical health, and silvery eyes. The virus conveys
immunity to many diseases - it will immediately infect and neutralize
microbes, for example - but does significant damage to the gut flora,
leading to severe chronic pain.

Many immortals are angry at their condition: they will live forever, and
suffer forever. Some manage to kill themselves, despite their
resilience. Others form cults, or are overthrown by fearful mobs.
Eventually, several immortals banded together to investigate their
condition, and if possible cure it - if that meant death, at least they
would know peace. They submitted themselves to investigation by Faraj
ben SƒÅlim, ^[[Faraj ben Salim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraj_ben_Salim)]
the Sicilian-Jewish physician and translator. In 1281, thanks
to the ability to dissect and analyze a human body while it still lived
and spoke, the group made a breakthrough. Though they do not speak of
it, the group found a way to cure their endless pain and live normal
lives. They banded together, taking the name Da'ath, or "knowledge" in
Hebrew, swearing to become masters of the living
world. ^[[Guilty Crown: Da'ath](http://guiltycrown.wikia.com/wiki/Da%27ath)]

In 1718, a member of Da'ath manages to experiment with the Progenitor
virus. He infects medicinal leeches with his own blood, which when
applied to a human corpse could give it a temporary un-life. His story
later forms the basis for Mary Shelley's story
"Frankenstein". ^[[Frankenstein](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein)]

In 1858, Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace introduce the theory of
evolution: genetic descent with modification due to natural selection.
Virchow, Schleiden, and Schwann develop the components of cell theory
around the same time. The Victorian zeitgeist takes such discoveries in
strange and unexpected directions. "Social darwinism", a term invented
in the 1880s, claims that "survival of the fittest" is a suitable
template for society, not merely a description of natural selection. The
Contagious Diseases Act is passed in 1864 and confines women accused of
venereal disease to "lock hospitals", disproportionately affecting the
female working class of Britain. ^[[Contagious Diseases Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagious_Diseases_Acts)]
This conflation of morality and biology
continues as a theme throughout the Victorian era.

This mixing of science and sociology comes to a head in 1893, when
Professor Emmanuel Hildern elaborates his theory of evil as a
transmissible plague and proposed, effectively, a vaccination against
it. He bases his theory on the discovery of a humanoid but non-human
skeleton, which develops tissue when exposed to water. Hildern is
eventually locked away in an asylum run by his brother, and no further
sign of the skeleton is found after a heavy rainstorm. ^[[The Creeping Flesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creeping_Flesh)]

According to Darwin's theory, biological mutations can arise by chance,
then spread broadly throughout a population. A radical change to the
environment can be sparked by a single surprising event. History
sometimes works in a similar fashion, and one particular spark came
about because of a king and a writer.

In 1862, King Otto of Greece is forced to abdicate the crown. It is
offered to Edward Bulwer-Lytton, the English novelist, poet, playwright,
and politician. Bulwer-Lytton is a noted Hellenophile and his books have
been well received by the public for years. Along with the offer,
Bulwer-Lytton receives a startling secret. Shaken by what he is told, he
declines the honor and returns to his work. Four years later, he is
elevated to Baron. ^[[Edward Bulwer-Lytton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bulwer-Lytton)]

In 1871, Bulwer-Lytton writes a fictionalized version of the secret he
was told, called "The Coming Race". This novel features an unnamed
narrator who discovers a way into a subterranean world. This inner Earth
is populated by a people called the "Vril-ya" with telepathic and
parapsychological abilities. Their civilization and powers are
attributed to mastery of a mystical substance called "vril", analogous
to electricity in its variety of applications. ^[[Vril](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vril)]

The concept of "vril" is seized upon by a number of occult thinkers,
including Rudolf Steiner, the literary critic, esoteric writer, and
founder of Anthroposophy. Steiner's thinking separates him from his
original comrades in the Theosophical movement, as he is more interested
in developing a philosophy that incorporates natural science than
following Theosophy's mystical mindset. ^[[Anthroposophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroposophy)]

The Wahrheits Gesellschaft, or "Society for Truth", emerges as an inner
circle of the Thule Society in 1911. The Society for Truth's members
have read "The Coming Race" and other sources, and conclude that it is
based on a true story. They begin searching for tangible evidence of
vril, driven by Steiner's naturalistic approach.

In 1927, Robert Olmstead visits the New England town of Innsmouth, as
part of a search for details of his own family line. He speaks with town
drunk Zadok Allen, and learns the secret history of the town. An
intelligent non-human species, the "Deep Ones", live under the sea, and
periodically come to shore to breed with human beings. Almost everyone
in Innsmouth is now a human-Deep One hybrid. Alarmed by this discovery,
Olmstead approaches the Federal authorities with convincing evidence,
causing them to send submarines and soldiers to Innsmouth. A general
cleanup of the town occurs, driving the Deep Ones further under the sea.
Olmstead himself commits suicide shortly thereafter, puzzling most
members of his family. ^[[The Shadow Over Innsmouth](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShadowOverInnsmouth)]

Officials who obtain the corpses of Deep Ones compare them to the 1893
writings of Professor Hildern, and conclude that his "mysterious evil
skeleton" was in fact a Deep One. The alarming conclusion is that the
creatures must have existed for at least 80,000 years.

Josef Mengele, the infamous Nazi doctor, joins the Nazi Party in 1937,
and the Schutzstaffel (SS) a year later. Heinrich Himmler, leader of the
SS, was a noted esoteric and member of the Thule Society. Himmler's
mystical leanings aren't of interest to Mengele, but some of the hints
uncovered by the Society for Truth and spoken of by the SS high command -
such as unusual human genetic potentials - fascinate him. He begins a
series of monstrous experiments on prisoners during the war, unhindered
by any sort of ethics or morality. He is assisted by other geneticists
and scientists, among them Brigid Tenenbaum and Henry Jelliff.

Mengele and Jelliff escape the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945 and move to
Paraguay. They continue their research into human cloning. The Battle of
Berlin ends May 2, 1945. Only July 9, the day a partial solar eclipse
occurs in Berlin, Brigid Tenenbaum finally uncovers evidence of vril in
a secret laboratory.

Prophase (1946 - 1961)
----------------------

Andrew Ryan flees Russia in 1919 as a child. His experiences under
the Soviet dominion of his homeland sour him on any sort of socialist or
collectivist system. He feels a similar disgust at America's "New Deal"
social programs. As a successful industrialist and capitalist, he
envisions a place where his ideals could be fully realized. He plans to
create his own city, untouchable by "parasites". ^[[Bioshock: Andrew Ryan](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/Andrew_Ryan)]

Following the bombing of Hiroshima, an event that Ryan sees as a
perversion of science, he creates blueprints for an underwater city
called "Rapture" that will serve as a home for the elite. Construction
commences in 1945. On November 5, 1946, Rapture is ready enough to
welcome its first citizens. Only the best and brightest receive
invitations, regardless of their origin or past history.

Operation Paperclip is started in 1945 by the OSS (the precursors
to the CIA), as an effort to acquire Nazi scientific expertise, or at
least deprive the Russians of it. ^[[Operation Paperclip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip)]
Andrew Ryan's well-known hatred for
the Soviet Union, his fluency in Russian, and his ties to the
military-industrial complex allow him to be an integral part of
Operation Paperclip. This in turn gives him access to the personnel
records of many of Germany's top thinkers. He offers to smuggle them to
safety in the United States, but channels several of them not to
American shores, but to Rapture.

Brigid Tenenbaum is one such recruit. She spends the next four
years researching vril and its applications in Rapture's laboratories,
as well as performing other scientific research. ^[[Bioshock: Brigid Tenenbaum](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/Brigid_Tenenbaum)]
She discovers a gene transfer mechanism in sea slugs that allow them
to acquire traits from algae they consume. ^[[Sea Slug Steals Photosynthesis Genes From Algae](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/sea-slug-steals-photosynthesis-genes-its-algae-meal/)]
Using this ability, she creates "ADAM", a viral precursor to the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing process, that
allows human beings to be genetically engineered to manipulate
vril. ^[[Bioshock: ADAM](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/ADAM)]

In her diaries, Tenenbaum records secret meetings between strange
humanoids and members of Rapture's leadership. She hints that this
contact may have been tied to the discovery of ADAM, and that these
beings - the Deep Ones - may enjoy their immortality and ability to
reproduce with humans thanks to their use of the proto-ADAM found in the
sea slugs. Electron micrographs of viral bacteriophages have been
available since 1940, and her diaries include similar micrographs
showing samples taken from Deep Ones.

From 1946 to 1952, construction continues on Rapture. In 1951,
Ryan's only law is passed: contact with the surface is forbidden. This
law creates a thriving black market under the direction of Frank
Fontaine, as the rich and influential citizens of Ryan's city are
accustomed to getting what they want. Fontaine works with his existing
contacts on the surface to create an "umbrella corporation" which will
act as a front for his smuggling operation. ^[[Bioshock: Frank Fontaine](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/Frank_Fontaine)]

Tenenbaum's research requires materials that only Fontaine's black
market pipeline can supply, and the two develop a working relationship.
Once ADAM is ready, Tenenbaum uses Fontaine's influence in the city to
manufacture and distribute it.

Tenenbaum lacks the technology to extract and work with DNA
directly, making the  *Elysia chlorotica*
slugs a vital resource in producing ADAM. By implanting these slugs into
a human host, ADAM synthesis can happen fast enough to meet Rapture's
growing demand for designer genetic engineering. The implantation
process requires immunosuppressive drugs which only function in
conjunction with XX chromosomes in a pre-pubescent individual. The
Little Sister's Orphanage, founded by Fontaine as a place for poor
families to send their children, becomes the breeding ground for ADAM
production, and the "Little Sisters" themselves are fuel for Rapture's
new habit. ^[[Bioshock: Little Sister](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/Little_Sister)]

Ryan, realizing the psychological pressures facing the citizens of
Rapture (lack of sunlight, close confinement, and so forth), brings in
Dr. Sofia Lamb, a brilliant psychologist. However, Dr. Lamb's altruistic
ideals contrast sharply with Ryan's "parasite" rhetoric, and she begins
to persuade the poorer segments of the population to abandon Ryan's
vision of Rapture.

In 1953, Professor Tom Nesbitt is involved in an atomic test in
the Arctic. The blast thaws out a cryogenically frozen Rhedosaurus
dinosaur, which follows the oceanic current from Baffin Bay to New York
City. The beast is killed with a radioactive isotope shot into its neck.
Before it dies, much of its blood is shed by attacking soldiers. This
blood contains ancient diseases to which modern humans have no
resistance. ^[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBeastFromTwentyThousandFathoms)]

Tenenbaum sends samples of the brain chemicals produced in the
Little Sisters to the surface for analysis in 1955. Dr. Paul Ruth
performs the analysis and concludes that the chemicals have great
potential. He synthesizes and distributes a drug called Ephemerol based
on his findings, marketing it as a safe tranquilizer for pregnant women.
Many women begin using it, including Ruth's own wife, who gives birth in
1956 and 1960.

By 1958, "Plasmids" - the fully realized fruit of Tenenbaum's
integration of vril and human genetics - become commercially available
in Rapture. These genetic weapons allowed people to start fires or
create lightning, freeze a target, or even move things telekinetically.
By 1959, the city has fallen into a civil war, stoked by the competing
visions of Andrew Ryan's twisted idealism, Frank Fontaine's
anything-goes capitalism, and Sofia Lamb's altruistic excess, and
empowered by ADAM and Plasmids. ^[[Bioshock: Rapture Civil War](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/Rapture_Civil_War)]

Andrew Ryan's mistress Jasmine Jolene becomes pregnant. Since much
of Rapture's critical technology was locked to Ryan's genetic code, his
biological child would have similar levels of access. Realizing the
possibilities, Fontaine purchases the embryo from Jolene in 1956. Dr. Yi
Suchong and Fontaine accelerate the development of this embryo to
maturity, using a biochemical treatment called "Lot 111". Dr. Suchong
implants mental conditioning into this individual, named "Jack". ^[[Bioshock: Jack](http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/Jack)]

In 1959, Joyce Webster finds her husband Paul at a secret science
lab in the Louisiana bayou. The facility, funded by Fontaine's smuggling
corporation and doing experiments for Dr. J.S. Steinman, is
experimenting with limb regeneration. As a side effect, the test
subjects are mutating into alligator-human hybrids. The lab is destroyed
in an explosion. ^[[The Alligator People](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAlligatorPeople)]

Jack is brought back to Rapture in 1960. Manipulated by Fontaine
under the guise of populist hero "Atlas", Jack kills Andrew Ryan. Dr.
Tenenbaum assists Jack in overcoming his mental conditioning, and
together the two rescue the remaining Little Sisters in Rapture. Jack
confronts and kills Frank Fontaine. Jack, Dr. Tenenbaum, and several of
the restored Little Sisters escape from Rapture in a bathysphere.

One of these Little Sisters is adopted by the Trevor family,
George and Jessica. They name their child "Lisa". ^[[Resident Evil: Lisa Trevor](http://residentevil.wikia.com/wiki/Lisa_Trevor)]

Metaphase (1961 - 1975)
-----------------------

Rapture couldn't keep its secrets forever. The First Biological
Warfare Command, alias "Blackwatch", is established in 1962 by DARPA and
the Department of the Army. The program's mandate is to secure America
against biological attack, but its leadership goes further: they want to
create new viral agents as weapons of war. ^[[Prototype: Blackwatch](http://prototype.wikia.com/wiki/Blackwatch)]

Dr. Tenenbaum was one of Andrew Ryan's Operation Paperclip
recruits, under the alias "Anna Zimmerman". Blackwatch's agents track
her down after her escape from Rapture, and manage to wrest some of the
secrets of ADAM from her. She refuses to work with them, and is killed
by government assassins. Blackwatch begins tracking down Jack and the
escaped Little Sisters, whose bodies have been significantly altered by
their exposure to ADAM.

In 1963, Blackwatch begins "Carnival I": the introduction of a new
"Redlight" virus into chimpanzees. Redlight is derived from the "Lot
111" treatment obtained from Tenenbaum, adapted into viral form. The
effects are immediate and positive: enhanced intelligence, strength, and
other physical features. ^[[Prototype: Carnival I](http://prototype.wikia.com/wiki/Carnival_I)]

By 1964, Blackwatch is ready to test the effects of the Redlight
virus on humans. The create an artificial town in Idaho, called "Hope",
and round up a genetically diverse population to inhabit the place. The
official story is that Hope is meant to test self-sufficient towns in
the event of a nuclear war. On June 11, 461 subjects are infected with
Redlight, told only that they are receiving routine immunization shots.
Unlike chimpanzee subjects, no immediate mutations or physical changes
were observed. 27 children, dubbed "Hope Children", were born to the
infectees in 1965. Their life expectancy was typically 3 years or
less. ^[[Prototype: Hope Children](http://prototype.wikia.com/wiki/Hope_Children)]

Blackwatch also sponsors the creation of a facility for studying
Redlight. This facility is buried underground near Flatrock, NV, and
dubbed "Wildfire". A series of protocols are put in place to keep
Wildfire safe, and if necessary to sterilize it with an atomic bomb. The
laboratory is equipped with every conceivable scientific tool for
studying microbial and viral lifeforms.

Frank Fontaine's investment in ADAM was richly rewarded. His
Umbrella Corporation has become independently wealthy thanks to
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, bioweapons, and genetic
engineering. Lord Oswald E. Spencer, one of the virologists and
independently wealthy to begin with, publicly becomes president of
Umbrella. In 1966, he, Dr. James Marcus, and Brandon Bailey make a
breakthrough in unlocking the double-stranded RNA virus they called "Progenitor".

Lord Spencer has a mansion in the Arklay Mountains designed and
built in 1967 as a place where research can take place away from
official scrutiny and Blackwatch's prying eyes. ^[[Resident Evil: Spencer Mansion](http://residentevil.wikia.com/wiki/Spencer_Mansion)]

Spencer also leads an expedition to the city of Ndipaya people,
during which his colleague Sir Edward Ashford dies due to viral exposure.
To cover their tracks in Africa, the Umbrella team releases an artificial
and rapidly-spreading virus into the ancient Ndipaya ruins. ^[[Resident Evil: Ndipaya](http://residentevil.wikia.com/wiki/Ndipaya)]
Blackwatch officers General Ford and Major General McClintock use a fuel bomb
to destroy the infected area, assigning the name "Motaba" to the viral agent they
found.

Spencer's real reason for creating the mansion is to get access to
George Trevor's daughter Lisa, and her unique "Little Sister"
physiology. Spencer does away with George, then forcibly administers the
Progenitor virus to Lisa and her mother Jessica on November 10, 1967.
When Jessica shows no interesting effects, Umbrella kills her. Lisa,
however, survives the process and is horribly altered. Umbrella extracts
a modified virus, the "G-virus", from Lisa's body. ^[[Resident Evil: G-Virus](http://residentevil.wikia.com/wiki/G-Virus)]

In 1968, Dr. Marcus are officially brought on board by Umbrella to
push Progenitor research forward. Spencer hope to use Progenitor's
unique infective and mutative properties as a substitute for ADAM, and
as a tool to achieve godhood.

By 1968, almost all the "Hope Children" were dead. The exception
was a child of a former Little Sister, now going by the name Elizabeth
Greene. Redlight turned Greene's body into a virus factory, and their
infections turned the other residents of Hope into a hive mind with one
purpose: defend and obey Greene. ^[[Prototype: Elizabeth Greene](http://prototype.wikia.com/wiki/Elizabeth_Greene)]

Alexander Ashford, son of deceased Lord Edward, begins
construction of a secret base in Antarctica to perform further viral
research. This work is completed in 1968. ^[[Resident Evil: Antarctic Base](http://residentevil.wikia.com/wiki/Antarctic_Base)]

In 1969, Blackwatch initiates "Operation Altruistic": the forced
purification of the Carnival II experiment site in Hope, ID. ^[[Prototype: Operation Altruistic](http://prototype.wikia.com/wiki/Operation_Altruistic)]
They capture or destroy all of the infected citizens, take possession of the
bodies of the Hope Children, and recover Elizabeth Greene and her child
(dubbed "Pariah"). ^[[Prototype: Pariah](http://prototype.wikia.com/wiki/Pariah)]

The Hope infectees controlled by Greene come in several varieties.
One, of a highly mobile and intelligent type dubbed a "Runner" by
Blackwatch, escapes the Hope military cordon. It flees, crossing 1400
miles to reach Piedmont, AZ (mistakenly labeled "Two Bluff" in
Blackwatch records). Robert Cross, then a captain in Blackwatch, tracks
the creature there, thankfully with minimal casualties along the way. He
is able to destroy it, but not able to prevent the resulting infection
of Piedmont's residents. Everyone except two people - the town drunk and
an infant child - subsequently dies. Blackwatch sterilizes the town with
a thermobaric weapon.

Blackwatch takes its Carnival II samples and dispatches government
scientists to Wildfire to study mutated microbes that survived the Hope
experiment, under the code name "Andromeda". After several tense days,
including the near obliteration of the facility by its inbuilt nuclear
weapon, the researchers discover that Andromeda itself has mutated into
a benign form. To maintain operational security, none of the researchers
are told the true origin of the microbe: instead, they are informed that
it came down as part of a crashed military satellite. ^[[The Andromeda Strain](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAndromedaStrain)]

In 1970, Anna Hart is born. In reality, she is a clone of Brigid
Tenenbaum, alias "Anna Zimmerman". Blackwatch has produced several other
clones, and fostered them into families identical to Tenenbaum's. Over
the next several years, the clones receive trace amounts of ADAM
harvested from Tenenbaum herself. Blackwatch hopes that ADAM's
memory-transferring properties will awaken Tenenbaum's memories and
genius in the clones.

Blackwatch creates a front company, the Rossum Corporation, to
invest in medical technologies and research that will validate the
presence of emergent memories in their Anna clones. To that end, Rossum
purchases the rights to magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, after it's
invented by Paul C. Lauterbur in September 1971. The corporation
gradually dissociates itself from Blackwatch to pursue the ambitions of
one of its executives, Clyde Randolph. ^[[Dollhouse: Rossum Corporation](http://dollhouse.wikia.com/wiki/Rossum_Corporation)]

In 1970, Andy McGee and Vicky Tomlinson meet in college. The next
year, the two are married and expecting their first child, Charlene.
They met as test subjects for a hallucinogen called "Lot 6". Like
Ephemerol, Lot 6 is derived from Rapture "Plasmid" biotechnology and the
mutated Little Sister physiology, but processed and concentrated. The
drug in their systems endows both of them with psychic abilities, and
finds its way into the brain of their unborn child Charlie. Charlie
herself is born in 1973. ^[[Firestarter](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Firestarter)]

The National Institute of Mental Health receives samples of
Redlight for further experimentation. They apply the virus to a
collection of rats and mice. Unbeknownst to the researchers, the rodents
acquire enhanced intelligence (and perhaps other special abilities), and
engineer their own escape from the NIMH facility
in 1971. ^[[Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MrsFrisbyAndTheRatsOfNIMH)]

Blackwatch manages to extract a sample of the viral infection
Elizabeth Greene used to control her fellow citizens in Hope. Although
the infection doesn't create a hive mind, it does induce gradual
insanity. This virus, code named "Trixie", is transported by airplane in 1973.
The plane crashes near Evans City, PA, and pollutes the local
water supply. The townsfolk are quickly driven insane by the infection,
while Blackwatch soldiers under the command of Colonel Peckem move in to
clean up, contain, or sterilize the city. ^[[The Crazies](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCrazies)]

Anaphase (1975 - 2009)
----------------------

Biology itself is now officially a threat to mankind. High-ranking
government officials, senior corporate officers, and experienced
biologists all consider the problem in their own way, and with their own
people. Their conclusions fall into two camps. Either humans need to be
improved, or people need to escape being human.

In 1975, rebel scientist Eddie Jessup experiments with a South
American hallucinogen which, in combination with sensory deprivation,
causes him to physically revert to a pre-human state. The hallucinogen
is derived from a plant called the  *Sonnentreppe*,
or "Stairway to the Sun", and also grows in West Africa. The
plant is a natural producer of the Progenitor virus, and Jessup's
physical transfiguration is linked to his deeply repressed religious
mania. ^[[Altered States](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlteredStates)]

Dr. Raymond F. McMullen founds Gentek on November 1, 1976. He
receives funding from the government's Blackwatch organization. The
company's purpose is to experiment on the Redlight virus, and to study
the research subject Elizabeth Greene. ^[[Prototype: Gentek](http://prototype.wikia.com/wiki/Gentek)]

Also in 1976, aging Nazi hunter Ezra Liebermann receives
information that Nazi scientist Josef Mengele has cloned Adolf Hitler 94
times. He is attempting to recreate the Fuhrer's mental state in the
clones by carefully shaping their upbringing, culminating in the killing
of their adoptive fathers. Rather than using Jelliff's more careful
approach, Mengele is determined to achieve quick results before he
himself dies. Liebermann is able to track and confront Mengele, and in
cooperation with another Nazi hunter, David Bennett, uncovers and
dismantles the cloning operation. ^[[The Boys from Brazil](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBoysFromBrazil)]

Dr. James Marcus, working under Lord Spencer and the Umbrella
Corporation, successfully engineers the Progenitor virus into the
"t-virus" on September 19, 1977, using Eddie Jessup's research as a
basis for understanding its transformative properties. Marcus further
experiments with infecting leeches in 1978, but later concludes that
humans would be better guinea pigs. The t-virus is a multi-use
biological weapon: it can kill and transform a population into ravenous
zombie-like creatures, while one in ten million people have the correct
genetic potential to mutate into monstrous living weapons called
"tyrants". A t-virus victim's mental state influences the mutation, and
only humans have sufficiently controllable mental states. ^[[Resident Evil: t-Virus](http://residentevil.wikia.com/wiki/T-Virus)]

The Umbrella research team responsible for the t-virus work to
understand how the anomalous development of extra mass occurs in the
bodies of infectees. They conclude that the mysterious "vril" is
responsible for the observed effects, and dub the products of the
t-virus (and similar life forms) as "VRIL" - Viral/Retroviral Intron
Lifeforms. The first VRIL creations - the zombie and a creature dubbed
the "Hunter" - show promise as a subset of VRILs called BOWs - Bio
Organic Weapons.

John Hammond was born in 1913. As a scientist, he has a string of successes already
behind him, but he is unable to conquer his real enemy: aging and death.
He creates the Hammond Foundation in 1979 to promote his research
into solutions such as cloning. ^[[Jurassic Park: Hammond Foundation](http://jurassicpark.wikia.com/wiki/Hammond_Foundation)]

Blackwatch's Department of Scientific Intelligence, also known as
"The Shop", kills Vicky Tomlinson in 1980. They pursue her family, Andy
McGee and his daughter Charlie, who has developed powerful pyrokinetic
powers. The pair are captured and separated, with members of the Shop
unsuccessfully attempting to gain Charlie's trust. The Shop's senior man
and much of the upper echelon is killed by Charlie herself, who also
blows up several of its buildings in the process.

In 1979, Dr. Hal Raglan's Somafree Institute of Psychoplasmics
demonstrates a revolutionary method of treating patients with
psychological issues. Dr. Raglan's method depends on an infusion of
modified ADAM, which doesn't require infusions of EVE but can have
unintended side effects. His star patient, Nola Carveth, begins
spontaneously manifesting her frustrations as deformed dwarfish
apparitions who kill the objects her frustrations. Eventually Nola's
husband convinces Dr. Raglan of the danger of his approach, and the
institute is closed. Dr. Raglan and Nola die, but her daughter Candice
(now showing signs of the psychoplasmic condition) escapes. ^[[The Brood](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBrood)]

In 1981, members of Mengele's cloning project join the Hammond Foundation as
research scientists. Hammond is interested in their human cloning work,
but they inform him that tremendous amounts of capital will be required
to create a clone that will retain his personality, not merely resemble
him. Hammond begins work on a radical idea: cloning dinosaurs and
stocking a park with them as live exhibits. He believes that this will
raise enough capital to fund his immortality research.

The children born after exposure to Ephemerol steadily reach
adulthood. All of them exhibit telepathic powers, but also suffer from
sensory overload, mental noise, and other side effects of uncontrolled
mind-reading. Dr. Ruth dubs them "Scanners", since they are able to scan
or make mental contact with other minds, even with computers. Dr. Ruth's
employer ConSec is interested in the security applications of the
Scanner power. When telepathic terrorist Darryl Revok disrupts a 1981
ConSec Scanner demonstration by killing the presenter, Dr. Ruth recruits
Cameron Vale, another Scanner with powerful latent abilities, to track
down and terminate Revok. In their final conflict, Revok kills Vale's
body, but Vale transmits his mind into Revok, overwriting his
personality. ^[[Scanners](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scanners)]

Anna Hart, one of the clones of Brigid Tenenbaum, learns of her
existence as a clone in 1982 with the aid of Michaela Dupont, who is
secretly also a clone. They confront Henry Jelliff, using Michaela's
knowledge of the cloning process in trade for the safety of the Anna
clones. ^[[Anna to the Infinite Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_to_the_Infinite_Power)]

Cloning the body is not enough to ensure immortality. One's
consciousness must also find its way into a new host. In 1984, the
Rossum Corporation uses their existing position as number one seller of
MRI machines to acquire mental maps of people around the world.
 They have a number of Scanners on the payroll, including Cameron
Vale (now in the body of Darryl Revok), and offer psycho-suppressive
drug treatments to keep them docile and sane. The Scanners, in turn, aid
Rossum's engineers in understanding how to imprint a human mind onto a
brain. Rossum develops a combination of magnetic and chemical processes
that lead to the first "Active": a human body whose brain is a blank
slate, ready to be programmed with a stored mind.

A chemical leak from Umbrella's New York City laboratory occurs in 1984.
Some of their mutagenic viral samples infect a small group of
turtles in the city sewers, causing significant physiological and mental
changes. They encounter a similarly mutated rat, a survivor of the NIMH
experiments, who has gained intelligence and martial arts skills over
the last decade. The new humanoid-hybrid animals are sought after by
Umbrella for their potential as weapons. They are hunted by Umbrella
foot soldiers, or "the Foot" - half-alive humans infected by a variant
t-virus, good for fighting but not much else. ^[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles)]

John Hammond's team clones a dinosaur in 1984, and he founds International
Genetics Incorporated, or "InGen", in 1985 to capitalize and monetize his
work. ^[[Jurassic Park: InGen](http://jurassicpark.wikia.com/wiki/InGen)]

Over the next several years, Rossum employs down-on-their-luck
individuals to function as Actives. The Actives are assigned to
"Dollhouses", scattered around the world in highly secretive locations,
and deployed on engagements for high-paying clients. They receive
synthetic personalities and skills to match the engagement's
requirements. Rossum's eventual goal is the development of personal
immortality through mind imprinting, and the Dollhouse is a way of
building up a base of well-heeled clients and researching the necessary
science. ^[[Dollhouse](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse)]

Clyde Randolph is betrayed by one of his business partners at
Rossum, and killed, in 1992. His conscious mind is transferred into "the
Attic", a virtual reality simulation hosted by the Rossum
mainframe. ^[[Dollhouse: Clyde Randolph](http://dollhouse.wikia.com/wiki/Clyde_Randolph)]

In the early 90s, Anna Hart is visited by a mysterious man who
only calls himself "Jack". He tells her the story of Brigid Tenenbaum,
the woman from whom she was cloned. He leaves a package of information
for her to read, and a word of advice: "don't just obey. Choose for
yourself." Now an adult, Anna has her legal name changed to Anna
Zimmerman, and begins the search for the Little Sisters of Rapture. Her
search quickly leads her to Blackwatch itself, the sponsors of the
cloning program which produced her. With the aid of Professor Bruckner,
an expert in cloning who was also aware of Mengele's attempt to
reproduce Adolf Hitler via cloning, Anna resolves to rescue the
surviving Little Sisters. Her records show that many of them have fallen
into Blackwatch's hands and are being used as experimental
subjects.

InGen demonstrates Jurassic Park to a private team of scientists
and investors in 1993. Due to sabotage of the park by InGen head
programmer Dennis Nedry, several dinosaurs escape their enclosures and
run rampant across the park. Nedry has been hired by InGen's rival to
deliver dinosaur DNA specimens, but he is killed by the very dinosaurs
he released before he can leave the island. Despite these serious
problems, John Hammond remains determined to make the park a reality.
Seeing the pleasure that dinosaurs gave to visitors, including his own
grandchildren, he loses interest in immortality research and plans to
focus entirely on the Park. ^[[Jurassic Park](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark)]

By 1995, Lisa Trevor has been exhausted of her potential to spawn
bio-weapons. Umbrella, having lost several personnel to her grief-driven
berserk rages, orders her termination. The effects of Umbrella's
treatment on her have reawakened and enhanced her Little Sister
durability, making her immune to almost any sort of attack. She is left
for dead, but is in reality in a sort of suspended animation.

The Motaba virus reappears in Zaire in 1995, motivating USAMRIID
(United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases)
virologists, other scientists, and members of the military to deal with
it. Colonel Sam Daniels and others manage to avert the destruction of
Cedar Creek, CA. ^[[Outbreak](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Outbreak)]
In the process, Col. Daniels' analysis of Motaba
reveals its ties to the Umbrella Corporation, prompting him to look
further into the company's history. He confronts Brigadier General Billy
Ford, who investigated the original outbreak and helped cover up
Umbrella's involvement.

In 1998, both Raccoon City and the Umbrella base in the Antarctic
both suffer t-virus outbreaks. The Raccoon City incident is investigated
by members of STARS - a program sponsored by Blackwatch to train law
enforcement personnel in detecting and combating "bio-crimes" - who
discover the Arklay Mountains mansion of Lord Spencer, and are set upon
by bio-organic weapons created by the t-virus. Raccoon City and the
Antarctic base are both eventually destroyed by nuclear devices to
contain the outbreak, and some of the STARS personnel do
survive. ^[[Resident Evil](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1)]

During the Raccoon City incident, Anna Zimmerman - who has joined
STARS under an assumed identity - finds and rescues Lisa Trevor in the
Spencer mansion. While Lisa is horrifically mutated and has been driven
to near total madness by her experiences, Anna's resemblance to her
long-lost "mother" Brigid Tenenbaum transfers Lisa's yearning for her
mother into loyalty to Anna. The two escape Raccoon City's destruction
together.

In the mid-90's, the ancient conspiracy Da'ath sponsors Operation
Manticore, a program to genetically engineer controllable
super-soldiers. They obtain DNA samples from the New York turtle
hybrids' blood, which Umbrella managed to secure during its battles with
them. With this as a foundation, Manticore begins work on human-animal
hybrids for use as soldiers. ^[[Dark Angel: Manticore](http://darkangel.wikia.com/wiki/Manticore)]

In 1999, in an attempt to treat Alzheimer's disease, sharks are
genetically engineered to serve as donors for a vital protein. As a
result, the animals become super-intelligent. They escape their
underwater cages and kill several members of the science team, but are
killed themselves. ^[[Deep Blue Sea](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeepBlueSea)]
Unbeknownst to the team, the program is a cover for Manticore.
From their perspective, they've gained valuable
data on human intelligence in a non-human body.

Manticore succeeds in creating the first of their "X5" series
human-animal chimeras in 2000.

Type S influenza, also known as the "Reaper virus", breaks out in
Scotland in 2008. After a fruitless search for the cure, the entire
country is quarantined.

On March 11, 2008, a weaponized form of rabies is released in an
apartment building. The CDC establishes a quarantine. Reporter Angela
Videl's footage is recovered from the scene, but there are no survivors
and the entire building is isolated and purged. ^[[Quarantine](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Quarantine)]
Unknown to the public at large, the virus was engineered by Da'ath.
Dr. Peter Farragut of the CDC is instrumental in preventing the spread
of the disease and performing an analysis of the virus itself.

Telophase (2009 - 2038)
-----------------------

Geneticists Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast work on a series of transgenic
human-animal hybrids in 2009. Their work is sponsored by a company
called NERD (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development), a front for the
secretive Operation Manticore. Their most successful creation is a being
called Dren, who is intelligent but inhuman in its behavior. A series of
tragedies and deaths close the program, but Manticore privately
considers the work a success. ^[[Splice](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Splice)]

In 2009, Alex J. Mercer wakes up in a Gentek morgue in Manhattan, as the
Blacklight virus overwhelms the city. With assistance from his sister
Dana, he opposes Blackwatch and the USMC to find pathologist Dr. Bradley
Ragland (half-brother to Dr. Hal Ragland). Ragland assists Alex in
confronting Elizabeth Greene. In the process, Alex comes to understand
that the real Mercer is now dead, having spitefully released Blacklight
into the population upon his death, and that "Alex" is a sentient entity
constructed by the Blacklight virus itself.

Blackwatch's General Randall is prepared to execute the Wildfire
protocol, obliterating Manhattan with a nuclear weapon to contain the
virus. Realizing that an electromagnetic pulse is enough to defeat the
virus in its current form, Alex takes off with the weapon aboard a
helicopter. The bomb itself doesn't physically damage Manhattan, but the
EMP successfully purges the infection. ^[[Prototype](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Prototype)]

The cost is staggering. The EMP pulse has wiped out the major data
centers of the East Coast, and the resulting power surge across a faulty
and antiquated electrical grid does tremendous damage to the North
American electronic infrastructure. This outcome, called "the Pulse", is
attributed by the military to terrorist action. ^[[Dark Angel: the Pulse](http://darkangel.wikia.com/wiki/The_Pulse)]

Among other effects, the Pulse also wipes out the delicate imprinting
tech being used by Rossum and its Dollhouses - perhaps for the best.

The Pulse paves the way for the Balkanization and fragmentation of the
United States as a single political entity. Autonomous regions,
indepence-minded microstates, corporate franchises, and even organized
crime groups eclipse the previous Federal government in power.

In 2009, several X5 super-soldiers escape a Manticore facility located
in Guilette, WY. They disappear into the offline darkness of
America. ^[[Dark Angel: '09 Escape](http://darkangel.wikia.com/wiki/%2709_Escape)]

In 2010, United Nations negotiator Edward Douglas crash-lands near an
island in the Java sea. He discovers the island is inhabited by a former
neurosurgeon named Montgomery, a geneticist named Dr. Moreau, and
Moreau's daughter Aissa. Douglas gradually discovers that Moreau was
responsible for experiments in animal-human hybridization on the
Manticore project. He now rules as a mad god-king over the hybrids of
the island, including Aissa herself. Douglas's arrival unbalances the
fragile tension of the island, leading to a general uprising and the
deaths of Moreau, Montgomery, Aissa, and several of the hybrids. Douglas
himself is able to escape and report his story. ^[[The Island of Doctor Moreau](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIslandOfDoctorMoreau)]

Over the next several years, corporations rise in power and influence,
without the restraint of government regulation. Although the largest and
oldest corporations have been ruined by the Pulse, their human resources
retain their skills. Meanwhile, the government consolidates and
privatizes.

In 2013, con artist Sarah Manning observes the suicide of a woman who
looks exactly like her. Taking advantage of the situation to steal the
woman's identity, Sarah eventually discovers she is one of several
clones and that Neolution, a secret corporate conspiracy headed by
Aldous Leekie, has an interest in her and her fellow clones. ^[[Orphan Black](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrphanBlack)]

In 2014, Dr. Alan Farragut and his team of CDC researchers fly to the
Arctic BioSystems research facility. Their goal is to contain and study
the Narvik virus, which has similarities to rabies, and was worked on by
Alan's brother Peter. Peter came to ABS's attention after his work with
the engineered rabies outbreak in 2008. The ABS facility is quickly
overrun by zombie-like "vectors", who are infected with the virus and
compelled to spread it to the uninfected. ABS's parent company, the
Ilaria Corporation sends senior executive Constance Sutton to contain
the situation. ^[[Helix](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Helix)]

In reality, Ilaria is a front for the ancient conspiracy of immortals
called Da'ath, with the virus a key element in their plans. Narvik
infectees will not attack Da'ath immortals, but will actively try to
infect other people, making it an imperfect but viable tool for world
conquest. The crisis ends with several members of Da'ath "killed" -
unable to move, but still somehow alive - and the ABS lab destroyed,
along with all samples of Narvik.

By 2015, the changing geopolitical climate makes big-budget funding from
defense departments unlikely. Many companies, such as InGen and Gentek,
leverage their in-house expertise in cloning and biotech in more public
ways. Companies like RePet offer a cloned copy of family pets, and human
organ cloning is a commercial business. Human clones are still
technically illegal, under "Sixth Day" laws, and corporations (publicly)
honor this restriction. Behind the scenes, Neolution continues to both
promote and hinder human cloning research to further their agenda of
reinventing human evolution.

Helicopter pilot Adam Gibson encounters billionaire Michael Drucker of
Replacement Technologies, whose company employs former Rossum employees
and Neolution members. Drucker intends to create a cabal of immortals,
whose minds can be copied from body to body. Gibson finds himself
cloned, and works with his clone to take down Drucker and reveal the
plot. ^[[The 6th Day](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/The6thDay)]

In 2016, freelance journalist/intel-operative Hiro Protagonist
encounters Snow Crash, a virus/drug/religion being promulgated by
industrialist L. Bob Rife. Rife's purely fiber-optic communication
network survived the Pulse, and as a result he now controls American
Internet traffic. Rife has acquired a "metavirus", able to affect the
human mind, and has repackaged it under the name "Snow Crash". Hiro, his
skateboard courier partner Y.T., and their allies stop Rife from
distributing Snow Crash widely and manage to shut down the distribution
network. ^[[Snow Crash](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowCrash)]

By 2017, the leadership of Blackwatch and the Umbrella Corporation are
systematically eliminated, or simply disappear. Careful observers
attribute this to a team of highly skilled and uniquely powered
individuals: a stern old man who mixes heavy firearms and elemental
powers, a STARS-trained genius gunslinger/geneticist, a humanoid virus
who can consume and assimilate memories, a multi-ethnic
hacker/swordsman, an aggressive pyrokinetic, and a woman who can summon
negative emotions into an ectoplasmic reality or shape it into humanoid
minions. They uncover the machinations of the Wahrheits Gesellschaft, or
"Society for Truth", still operating behind the scenes and guiding
vril-empowered virus research, and manage to overthrow the Society's key
members.

In 2019, X5 super-soldier "Max" works for a bicycle courier service in
Seattle, called Jam Pony. She comes to learn more about the Manticore
program, and works to rescue other X5s from Manticore's custody. ^[[Dark Angel](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DarkAngel)]

While Replacement Technologies was exposed by Adam Gibson, other
companies quietly acquire its assets and human resources. Merrick
Biotech establishes several facilities where clones of famous or wealthy
individuals are force-grown and prepared as physical or mental backups
should their originals become sick or die. The clones themselves are
told that the outside world is intensely contaminated, but that there is
a lottery system allowing a few of them to visit a safe haven. While
they are mental duplicates of their originals thanks to Dollhouse
technology, they are also engineered to be more docile and controllable.
Clones Richard, Lena, Lincoln Six Echo, and Jordan Two Delta overcome
their programming through curiosity, escape from the confinement zones
in 2019, and learn the truth about their
situation. ^[[Clonus](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clonus)] ^[[The Island](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIsland)]

By 2020, several prominent individuals have passed away or disappeared.
Jack has passed away from old age, accompanied at his last moments by
nearly every surviving Little Sister. Most of them have thankfully lived
ordinary lives, and the last thing Jack sees is their grateful smiles.
Alex Mercer encounters his genetic complement, Elizabeth Greene's
psychopathic child Pariah, and both perish. As a result, the last
samples of the Blacklight virus are now eradicated.

In 2022, a meteorite strikes Tokyo, Japan. The Da'ath conspiracy
discovers it, and uncovers an extraterrestrial viral element. Through
analysis, they discover that the Progenitor virus and the alien sample
show distinct signs of common ancestry. The history of super-viruses on
Earth may in fact start in outer space. Da'ath begins work on this new
sample. ^[[Guilty Crown: Apocalypse Virus Meteorite](http://guiltycrown.wikia.com/wiki/Apocalypse_Virus_Meteorite)]

On December 24, 2029, the meteorite is discovered by a trio of children.
One of the children, Mana, is found by the secret Da'ath lab stationed
nearby. Finding that the child is already ill with an untreatable form
of cancer, she is injected with a modified version of their current
viral agent as a test - their reasoning is that her life is over anyway.
She escapes, becoming Patient Zero of what will later be called the
"Apocalypse Virus". ^[[Guilty Crown: Apocalypse Virus](http://guiltycrown.wikia.com/wiki/Apocalypse_Virus)]

Apocalypse is the second attempt by Da'ath to engineer a worldwide
system of control through a viral mechanism. It incorporates the "hive
mind" element of Redlight - Mana is able to control the actions of
infectees - and provides both a ready supply of vril and a means to
manipulate it. The subjects retain their intelligence, but can still be
kept docile and controllable.

Apocalypse spreads wildly throughout Japan, in an event that will be
called "Lost Christmas". The rest of the world hurriedly works to
isolate Japan. What's left of the United Nations organizes GHQ - Genomic
Headquarters - to deal with the outbreak, find a cure, and contain the
spread of the virus at all costs. ^[[Guilty Crown: Lost Christmas](http://guiltycrown.wikia.com/wiki/Lost_Christmas)]

In 2035, the Reaper virus is confirmed in London. A military team is
sent to Scotland by GHQ to recover data on a possible cure, after
satellite imagery discovers signs of survivors. The team, led by Major
Eden Sinclair, finds only survivors with a natural immunity, who have
regressed into cannibalistic barbarity, adopting medieval weapons and
customs. ^[[Doomsday](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Doomsday)]

Division (2039 - forward)
-------------------------

By 2039, blood and DNA tests had become mandatory for several of the
"doomsday" viruses or genetic abnormalities that had threatened mankind.
When a broad-spectrum immunity factor was discovered in human DNA, the
law went one step further. Babies would be engineered with the immunity
factor, no exceptions. Automated testing would become routine.

Many - later, most - families opted to go further. If a child could be
made resistant to disease, could the genetic engineers go further,
making those children smarter, stronger, or better as well? The
mechanics of genetics were well understood. Germline engineering became
the new normal. A generation of "designer babies" came to dominate the
world. George Glenn, astronaut and later the man who will be known as
the first "Coordinator", is born in 2039.

In 2039, Shu Ouma is an ordinary high school student in Japan. GHQ has
locked the country down. Patrols are everywhere, ready to drag away any
Apocalypse infectees. The infection is easy to spot: the virus literally
transforms parts of the body into a strange crystal, in reality
solidified vril. Shu encounters Inori Yuzuriha, who introduces him to
the anti-GHQ resistance cell "Funeral Parlor" and its leader, Gai
Tsutsugami.

Through a series of events, Shu obtains the Void Genome - a modification
of the Apocalypse Virus capable of extracting solidified vril from a
person and transforming it into a tool or weapon appropriate to the
donor's personality. These creations of vril are called "Voids". The
Void Genome creates a specialized gland in the right arm of the user,
and loss of the arm means the user is unable to conjure Voids. In
addition, the destruction of a person's Void leads to a fatal and
near-instantaneous transfiguration into solidified vril.

With Funeral Parlor's help, Shu fights back against GHQ. The
organization responds with even more force, finally partitioning Tokyo
completely and isolating all residents. After much struggle, betrayal,
and heartache, Shu and his friends manage to purge the Apocalypse Virus
itself from Japan. GHQ eventually relents and releases Japan from their
control. Shu and his allies retreat into obscurity, but not before
confronting Da'ath and their "envoy" Yuu, who have attempted to use the
Void Genome to take over the world. ^[[Guilty Crown](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GuiltyCrown)]

In the next 20 to 30 years, disease is all but eradicated. Society is a
fearsome police state, closely scrutinizing people and their health. Any
corporation dealing with genetic engineering is strictly monitored, to
prevent another apocalyptic virus or biological monstrosity. The high
level of tension leads to several wars: the Pan-Asian war, the Third
Gulf war, and others. While traditional bioweapons are considered
verboten, genetically engineered super-soldiers are created and deployed
in these conflicts. During peacetime, society struggles to re-integrate
its living weapons.

By 2053, animal-human hybrids and genetically engineered humans are a
fact of life. Edward Douglas's report on Dr. Moreau's activities has led
to a long-standing fear and mistrust of any such creatures, and
half-human "Moreaus" and engineered "frankensteins" are second-class
citizens at best. Private detective and tiger-human hybrid Nohar
Rajasthan is hired to investigate the death of a conservative
anti-moreau politician, which leads him to uncovering evidence of
Da'ath. Nohar only learns hints: Da'ath seems interested in pushing
humanity away from a mechanistic technology and toward a biotech-driven
future, one that they can control with their mastery of biology. ^[[Moreau Series](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MoreauSeries)]

Humanity turns to space to satisfy its need for natural resources, as
the exhausted Earth has suffered. Nation struggles against nation, even
as the "Cosmic Calendar" is inaugurated in 2055 in an attempt to bring a
fragmented world back together. Many older Moreaus are re-activated as
soldiers, and second-generation Moreaus are offered full citizenship in
exchange for military service in the new conflict.

Artificially created Frankensteins, such as the Nexus-6 Replicants
created by the Tyrell Corporation, are extensively used in space, both
as workers and soldiers in the ongoing conflicts. Some escape to Earth,
only to be hunted by specially trained police units called "Blade
Runners". One such group manages to get to Earth, then kill the head of
the Tyrell corporation, noted geneticist Eldon Tyrell. ^[[Blade Runner](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner)]
Meanwhile, the Rossum Corporation continues to use its "Active" technology in the
creation of cloned humanoid automatons called "Universal Robots", who
can be mentally programmed for highly skilled and specialized
tasks. ^[[R.U.R.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RUR)]

Nuclear weapons are deployed on the front lines of central Asia, in the
Kashmir region, in 2056. The wholesale destruction of Kashmir's
industrial facilities reduces much of the fighting to hand-to-hand or
close-quarters combat, where the Moreaus' natural talents give them a
decisive edge.

Biological weapons are unleashed around the world as well, killing even
civilian populations or threatening them with organ failure. Companies
like GeneCo emerge, providing synthetic organs to the sick for a profit.
Organ "repo men" exist, who will reclaim such organs - and
coincidentally harvest the other organs of a defaulting client who dies
during "reclamation" - if the client doesn't keep up their
payments. ^[[Repo! The Genetic Opera](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RepoTheGeneticOpera)]

The formal end of the "Reconstruction War" is in 2064, or C.E. 9 in the
new calendar. The construction of the Lunar city, Copernicus, begins the
next year, and is completed in 2067 (C.E. 11). ^[[Gundam SEED: Reconstruction War](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Reconstruction_War)]

Unlike earlier wars in the century, the Reconstruction War is generally
seen as ending well for all involved. The public has been familiar with
Moreaus for a generation, and their heroic feats and victories in battle
shift attitudes positively toward genetic engineering.

By 2070, designer babies are the default condition for the developed
world. The population is divided into "valids" (those with engineered
DNA and no handicaps) and "invalids" (those born naturally). The Gattaca
Aerospace Corporation begins planning a mission to the Jovian moon of
Titan. Vincent Freeman, an "in-valid", has dreamed of space flight since
he was a child. He obtains the aid of Jerome Morrow, a "valid" with
excellent genetics who was crippled in an accident, to pass himself off
as a genetically acceptable "valid". ^[[Gattaca](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gattaca)]

Vincent is successful in getting aboard the Titan mission, and serves
under senior astronaut George Glenn. Scientists studying L. Bob Rife's
"metavirus", and the Apocalypse Virus meteor responsible for Lost
Christmas, have traced both to the Jovian system. The Gattaca vessel,
named "Tsiolkovsky" after the Soviet rocket scientist, will spend seven
years exploring Jupiter. Their hope is to establish whether or not
extraterrestrial life - even a virus - really exists.

Before leaving, Glenn makes an impassioned speech to the world's
population, asking that genetically engineered people become
"Coordinators" rather than controllers, guiding mankind rather than
ruling it, and urging a more egalitarian society. ^[[Gundam SEED: George Glenn](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/George_Glenn)]
Unfortunately, his message is not received as intended, and societal friction arises
between the "valid" and "in-valid" factions. "In-valids" claim a new
name for themselves: "Naturals". In 2072, the bioterrorist group Blue
Cosmos launches attacks against hospitals performing genetic enhancement
on unborn children. ^[[Gundam SEED: Blue Cosmos](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Blue_Cosmos)]

In 2084, the Tsiolkovsky returns from Jupiter with "Evidence 01", the
first known extraterrestrial fossil. ^[[Gundam SEED: Evidence 01](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Evidence_01)]

The first permanent L5 space colonies, called PLANTs and shaped like
extended hourglasses, become ready for population. Due to the demands of
living in space full-time, only Coordinators - now the accepted term for
all genetically-engineered humans - are accepted aboard. The PLANTs
become a nexus for scientific progress and artistic accomplishment due
to the presence of so many "improved" humans. The next year,
anti-Coordinator terrorism is aimed at PLANT inhabitants who come to
Earth, driving a wedge between the space-dwelling Coordinators and the
planet-bound Naturals.

On February 5 of C.E. 70 (2125 AD), a joint peace conference being held
at the lunar city Copernicus is struck by a terrorist attack, wiping out
the entire United Nations's leadership. War breaks out between Earth and
the Plants on February 11. ^[[Gundam SEED: First Alliance-PLANT War](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/First_Alliance-PLANT_War)]

The Treaty of Junius in C.E. 73 marks the end of hostilities, but fails
all of its major political objectives. A second war soon breaks out,
which includes nuclear strikes and other weapons from both sides. After
much heartbreak and sacrifice, including the deaths of senior leaders on
both sides, a ceasefire is announced in C.E. 74. ^[[Gundam SEED: Second Alliance-PLANT War](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Second_Alliance-PLANT_War)]

Blue Cosmos releases a final apocalyptic bioweapon attack that spreads
across the world, but ironically fails to contaminate the PLANT
population. Earth's remaining human population is nearly obliterated as
a result. Lacus Clyne, then leader of the PLANTs, announces that a plan
to reboot the devastated Earth's biosphere. Corrupted soil must be
purified; radiation must be purged. The effort will take centuries. In
the meantime, many Coordinators leave Earth orbit, in an effort to
colonize the Jovian system.

The PLANT repopulation plan involved the creation of a vast forest (to
leech poison from the soil) and the engineering of giant insect
guardians (to reboot the animal-plant biosphere). The Alliance-PLANT
wars are remembered a millennium later as "the Seven Days of Fire" by
human survivors on Earth, and the forest becomes known as the "Sea of
Corruption" for the poisonous miasma found there. The human population
has formed kingdoms such as Torumekia and the Dorok Empire, echoing the
return to Medieval form once seen in Scotland during the Reaper
outbreak. Such kingdoms live in uneasy alliances with each other, as
well as struggling to survive the spreading Sea of Corruption itself.

During this time, Nausicaa, princess of the Valley of Wind and daughter
of its king Jhil, forms a strange bond with the insect life. She
functions as both scientist and mediator, studying the forest and
searching for ways for humans and the forest to co-exist. During this
time, she encounters Princess Kushana of Torumekia, Asbel of Pejite, and
other national leaders, and tries to convince them - with varying levels
of success - that cooperation is better than war for ensuring human
survival. She penetrates to the heart of the forest, learning of the
ancient humans' plan to reboot the Earth at the cost of the lives of
those now on the planet. ^[[Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind)]

Faced with the choice of allowing ancient humanity to return to the
planet of their birth, or saving the lives of those now living there,
Nausicaa disables the computer which manages the reclamation program and
would have otherwise sent a signal into space when the plan was
complete. The Sea of Corruption will continue to spread, eventually
unifying into a single functional entity.

Human beings are now forced to live within the forest, adapting to it
and adapting it in turn to their own needs. In effect, humanity is now a
virus with the world as its host. Only time will tell if its presence is
beneficial or not.
