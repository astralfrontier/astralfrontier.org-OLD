If you're reading this page, it's possible that some sequence of events happened like this:

1. You said something about "SJWs" or "political correctness"/"PC" or a related topic
2. In saying so, you claimed some variation of this idea: _People are wrong for saying when something offends them, and other people ought not give in to what they ask for._
3. I responded with a link to this page

If this is not you, feel free to bail out now.

If this is you, here's my version of what just happened:

1. You got offended by something you heard, saw, or read about
2. You said that it offended you
3. You asked for something to go differently as a result of your offense

Or in other words, _you are the thing you just spent time complaining about_.

Now why is that?

Why is it not okay for _you_ to be offended, but not the person you're talking about?

**"I'm in the majority!"**

Of what? People in the discussion? People in America? What majority applies to you? Why does being in a majority give you the privilege of being offended? I think if you consider that question, the only place you'll end up is "because we'll hurt the minority if they call us on it". If there's any other possible conclusion, I expect you to explain it to me.

**"Whatever the other people are offended about isn't really offensive!"**

To you, maybe. Who are you to dictate taste to other people?

**"Things have always been this way, why should anything change?"**

For most of human history, we didn't have the Internet either. You were okay with _that_ change when it gave you a forum to vent about how awful it is to care about other people. Being "traditional" doesn't make something better.

**Some other reason**

Take it to the comments, and please keep it civil.
